<p class="ph3">NARRAPORWIDGEE.</p>


<p>“Seven o’clock!” exclaimed father, throwing
his hat (with a very dirty puggaree on
it) upon the drawing-room sofa. “Isn’t
that confounded boy back yet?” Mother
looked up from a low chair with her gentle
face of reproof. She had a great objection
to strong language, and, to do him justice,
father seldom used it; but he was hot and
tired, poor man, after drafting sheep all
day in a north wind, and, moreover, the
boy in question had gone to post for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
English letters, and was half an hour
beyond his usual time for returning.</p>

<p>“He started late,” said mother. “Pat
Malony wanted him to help to put out a
fire in the lake paddock. Go and change
your dress, my dear, and we’ll have dinner.
I think the wind is turning; it is not
quite so hot as it was.”</p>

<p>Father obediently took himself off, puffing
and blowing and wiping his forehead
vigorously, his dirty puggaree flapping
against his dirty grass-cloth coat (I don’t
think he would have presented himself to
us in that costume if it had not been mail
day). Mother folded up her work and laid
it neatly in her basket. I rushed out upon
the verandah to consult the stable weathercock,
and, finding that it indicated a blessed
south sea-breeze coming round, flourished
up all the blinds and flung open all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
windows, which had been tight shut since
early morning from the oven heat outside.</p>

<p>“Gently, my dear!” called mother
after me, as the tail of my thin dress
whisked round a rough bole of grape vine
clasping a verandah post, and the bottom
flounce parted with half a yard of lace.
“I wish you would move more quietly,
Kitty.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could, mother, but this lovely
air is intoxicating,” I responded, tucking
up my tail and dancing down upon the
lawn and back again, with my hands
stretched out. “I believe it will be <i>cold</i>
by bed-time, really.”</p>

<p>The dinner bell rang, and I went indoors
through the dining-room window, and took
my seat at table. Father, spruce and fresh
after a bath and change of clothes, stood
up over a pair of boiled fowls, and shut his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
eyes, and muttered briskly, “For what
we are going to receive—wing or breast,
my dear?”—as if it were all one sentence
(another little habit he had which mother
would have liked to break him of, if she
had not known her place too well). And
mother, looking with her calm eyes upon
the sun-browned, arid landscape beyond
the garden gate, remarked, as she helped
herself to a slice of pork, “I see Sandy
now, crossing the ford. Let us get dinner
over before we open the bag.”</p>

<p>We generally did what she told us, and
we did now; but dinner was a brief ceremony
in consequence. The fowls gave
place to the puddings, and the puddings
to the cheese, with a celerity that Ah Foo,
the Chinaman cook, was not used to these
hot days, and we left a lovely dish of
raspberries and cream untouched for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
first time that year. (N.B.—It was nearly
the end of January, and they were just
going out of season at Narraporwidgee.)
Mother rose with her accustomed dignity,
and went into the hall to sort the servants’
letters into the hands of Bridget the
parlour-maid. She selected her own correspondence
from the remainder, gave
several letters and a bundle of newspapers
to father, and then deliberately hung up
the bag on its proper peg. Finally, we
went out and seated ourselves on the
verandah, now cool and breezy, with one
of those sudden evening changes peculiar
to the Australian climate; and father commenced
operations by reading his newspaper
telegrams aloud, as usual, and then
tearing open the one English letter he had
received.</p>

<p>“Well!” he exclaimed presently, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
continued gazing at his letter, with a
complacent smile on his honest face. Of
course mother and I looked up at him
expectantly.</p>

<p>“The market not gone down yet?” she
inquired.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied; “I believe the tide
is on the turn, but it hasn’t turned yet.
Prices may even rise a little more, Norton
thinks.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, I am very glad,” said mother;
and so she looked, though she never visibly
excited herself. She knew quite well that
the price of wool, even at its then rate, if
it lasted long enough (until father’s shipment
arrived in London) meant an increase
of a great deal to our income for the year;
and she knew, too, that that increase meant
so much more promise for her of the fulfilment
of a great hope and scheme that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
had cherished for many years. It was
pathetic to see the wistful eyes that she
lifted to his, as he continued to look in
her face steadily.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know what you’re thinking of,”
said he; “and I have been thinking of it
too. I believe it might be managed now.
I said to myself only this morning, while
I was drafting those ewes, ‘If wool makes
as much this year as it did last, I can
afford to turn the whole concern over to
somebody else, and Mary shall have her
wish.’ So you shall,” he added, letting his
broad palm fall upon her shapely shoulder.
“We’ll wait till we hear the bales are in
the market, and we’ll start home by the
very next mail, if you like.”</p>

<p>I looked at mother, and her face was
a study. A delight that would have overbalanced
the self-possession of anybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
else struggled to break through her cloak
of dignified reserve, and she would not
let it. Her eyes grew moist, and her
mouth twitched at the corners; but she
just took father’s hand from her shoulder,
and laid it to her lips, and replied, gently,
“Thank you, my dear; I shall be very
glad. It will be such a good thing for
Kitty.”</p>

<p>When father was a young man (what
he calls a young man, about thirty-eight
or forty years of age), he and mother
came out to Australia to seek their fortunes,
bringing me, a baby, with them.
My grandfather had died several years
before, leaving a home-made will, and my
uncle, his eldest son, his sole executor;
and uncle James, of whose integrity and
uprightness no one had ever had the
faintest suspicion, was tempted by some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
flaws in that irregular testament to take
a mean advantage of his brother and
sisters. My father, who was the last to
see evil in any one, let things drift a
little while, not suspecting mischief; but
when the truth was suddenly forced
upon him he arose to do battle for himself
and his sisters with all his might
and main. Aunt Alice and aunt Kate
were both married, and of course their
husbands joined the fray, with their respective
family solicitors; and very soon
the affair got into Chancery, and into the
hands of about fifty lawyers (speaking
roughly), and, after two or three years
of suspense and misery, my father and
my aunts—who had only right on their
side, while uncle James had the law on
his—found themselves no better off than
if grandpapa had left them nothing, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
indeed, rather worse. Aunt Alice’s husband
was a wealthy London merchant,
and scorned to consider the loss of such
a trifle as &#163;5000; and aunt Kate’s husband,
who was a dignified country rector of old
family and ample means, paid his fees
gracefully, and comforted aunt Kate by
an extra allowance of pin-money thenceforth.
But my poor daddy, hot and sore
with indignation and defeat, reckless and
disgusted with everybody and everything,
gathered together what few hundreds he
could call his own, told mother to pack
up her clothes, and her plate and linen,
and anything else she cared to keep,
advertised his house and furniture, took
our passages in the <i>Great Britain</i>, and
shook the dust of his native land from
off his feet for ever. “For ever” was
what he said, and mother made no protest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
at the time against a sentence of perpetual
banishment which almost broke her heart.
Everything comes to those who wait, it
is said: mother was wise and waited, and
the things she wished for certainly did
seem to come to her, sooner or later.</p>

<p>They had had hard times in their early
years of exile. Father had not felt his
privations on his own account: he was
a vigorous, enterprising, hopeful man, to
whom difficulties came with a certain
pleasant zest. He was a born gentleman,
too (though I say it that shouldn’t), and
so was never troubled with those scruples
of gentility which cause such poignant
distress to many people in what they call
“reduced circumstances.” He delighted
in his skill as groom and gardener, builder
and bricklayer, wood-cutter and butcher,
and Jack-of-all-trades, and understood that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the doing of all that rough work well
conferred a new dignity of manhood upon
him. As far as himself was concerned,
I believe those struggling years were the
happiest of his life, judging from the tone
of his reminiscences, which is always
tender, and heartfelt, and vaguely regretful.
It was mother who suffered—poor
mother!—without a word of complaint,
of course. She had to be left alone
whole days together, while father was
working on his run, and the blacks used
to prowl about the house and terrify her.
There were swagmen turning up at all
hours for rations—very shady characters,
some of them; and there were the bushrangers
(who, to be sure, never came, but
<i>might</i> have come, which was almost as
bad). The snakes used to glide between
the shrunk boards of the floors; the wild<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
dogs used to make her blood run cold with
that dreadful howl of theirs at nightfall,
when they came sniffing round after the
sheep; the native cats were her torment
in the poultry-yard, and the opossums as
bad in the orchard. Worse than any of
these, there were the wretched trolloping
women—that was father’s description of
them—that she had to do with for servants,
when lucky enough to get servants at all,
who wore her life out with coarse words
and ways. Little brothers and sisters
were born in the wilderness, and poor
mother had to fall back upon an awkward
man and a little child (me) to wait on her
properly, and make her a decent cup of
gruel when she wanted it. And the babies
died in the wilderness, too, with little or
no doctor’s skill to help them, and had
to be laid in their little graves under a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
wattle tree, with only their parents’ love
and tears to consecrate the ground.</p>

<p>But these were very old times. Father
made money rapidly, as no steady and persevering
man could well help doing, under
the circumstances; and money, of course,
brought us comfort in all sorts of ways.
As fences meandered all over the run, and
stock increased, and the value of wool with
it, the weatherboard house grew bigger
and bigger, and its new rooms were furnished
more and more luxuriously. Then
a better class of domestics, and many more
of them, appeared in the colony, railways
were opened, townships were founded and
grew and flourished, lawyers and doctors,
and police magistrates and bankers, began
to organize some system of society in those
little centres of population. We were able
to drive to church over a macadamized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
road, instead of being restricted to a family
service in the dining-room at home, as for
ten years had been the case; and I was
fortunate enough to possess in my governess
an accomplished and well-bred lady.
By-and-by, from a well-to-do squatter,
father became an extensive landowner and
a rich man. He bought his land easily by
instalments before free selectors had discovered
its value; and then land in Victoria
suddenly rose to a great price, and
his erewhile moderate estate became worth
&#163;60,000 at the lowest market rate. He
had preferred sheep to cattle always; and
at this time the owners of sheep stations
had such a run of luck, in good seasons
and high prices, for a few years, as they
probably never had before, and seem never
likely to have again.</p>

<p>Just at this flood-time in his fortunes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
and before the evil days of drought and
bad government fell upon the colony in
general, and the class in particular to
which he belonged, that memorable mail
arrived from England which decided him
to sell his property and go home. Just at
first (when mother and he talked over their
plans on the verandah that night) he
seemed disinclined to sell, and proposed
to leave a manager in charge of everything.
But mother, without in the least
assuming to give advice, suggested the
difficulty of finding a man at once capable
and trustworthy enough for so responsible
a post, and the probability that such years
of prosperity as we had had latterly would
not, in the nature of things, last much
longer. It had always been a land of
vicissitudes, in which men made and lost
fortunes with equal celerity; and suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
now (she hinted in the most modest
manner) that droughts came and the
stock died from starvation, or suppose the
scab broke out again and swept them off,
or suppose these high prices fell, as they
were bound to do some time or another, or
an ignorant Government succeeded in turning
everything upside down.</p>

<p>“Then, perhaps, it would be wisest to
sell,” said father, in a tone of deliberation
that meant he had made up his mind to do
so; but he sighed as he thought of all his
improvements, and what a nice place he
had made of it.</p>

<p>The fact was, father had an idea of
coming back again, and I am sure mother
never meant he should, if she could help it.</p>

<p class="ph3">AN UNEXPECTED PLEASURE.</p>


<p>I had my share in the conversation—and
the lion’s share it always was—until Bridget
brought tea out to the verandah. I
was wild with excitement at this mighty
change in my fortunes and the novel experiences
in store for me, and I wanted
immediately to know all about everything,
from cabin furniture to the Zoological
Gardens and Madame Tussaud’s, wild
beasts and waxwork being objects which
(grown up though I was, or thought I
was) appealed far more strongly to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
imagination than the museums and operas
and picture-galleries that mother tried to
tempt me with. By-and-by, however, I
began to see that I bothered them a little,
and that they had higher matters to talk
over. So, when I had taken my cup of
tea, I left them to enjoy theirs in peace,
and, wrapping myself in a light scarf that
hung in the hall, went down into the
garden for a stroll.</p>

<p>It was a lovely, soft, cool night, raging
hot and nasty though all the day had been.
The north wind blew no longer, as if from
the mouths of a million red-hot ovens: it
had gone almost round to the south, and
came rustling, fresh and sweet, through
the trees and shrubs, with a dewy smell
of flowers (from the few the drought had
left) mingling with the faint hay scent
of the burnt-up paddocks. There was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
little crescent moon shining above the
many roofs of the low house and outbuildings,
showing the delicate transparency
of the atmosphere, even on a
cloudy night, as never moon could show
me in England afterwards. Some great
oleander trees (it would have been an
insult to call them bushes) blushed rosily
out from the half-darkness, nodding their
pink bunches over the verandah roofs, as
if proud to remind me that they were
nearly all I had to depend upon in this
scorching weather for the innumerable
flower-vases that I loved to scatter all over
the house.</p>

<p>It was such a sweet night, that it made
me (even me) feel, all at once, a little
melancholy. I began to think of some
things I had forgotten in my first burst
of excitement at the prospect of going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
home. It occurred to me, for the first
time, to wonder whether I should really
like England as well as my own dear
Narraporwidgee? And could I part with
Spring, my canine familiar, who was as
much my shadow as any witch’s black
cat? He was sniffing round my petticoats
now, poking his wet black nose under
my arm and into my face, as I leaned on
the garden gate, in an attitude of contemplation
that he was not used to, and
could not understand.</p>

<p>The dear old dog! He seldom took a
night’s rest anywhere but on the verandah
outside my door—the glass door that was
also the window of my bedroom; and if
I did let him lie under my bed in the
daytime when it was blinding hot outside,
he was <i>my</i> dog, and it was nobody’s
business but my own. Who would understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
his ways and wants as I did? Who
would take him down to the dam and the
river for his swims, and see that he got
the bits of mutton he liked best? And
how could he bear his life without me?</p>

<p>At this stage of my meditations, when
my eyes were filling with tears, and I was
wildly resolving to pay his passage and
smuggle him along with me somehow, if
I had to sell my new watch and chain to
do it, Spring jumped out of my embraces
with a sudden energy that nearly knocked
me over, and darted in pursuit of a
wretched little opossum that was just
scuttling up the trunk of my favourite
plum tree. He scratched my arm with
his iron claws, and I did not cry over him
any more.</p>

<p>I began to think of the plums, which
would be ripe enough for jam in another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
week or two. Oh, who would make
the jam? And who would eat it? I had
visions of strange people rudely criticizing
our pretty house, rummaging about
mother’s dainty store-rooms, and tramping
over our sacred Persian carpet with muddy
boots; and they made me very sad.</p>

<p>Then, by the vague moonlight, I saw the
horses in the home paddock quietly sauntering
about and enjoying the night air,
and amongst them I easily recognized my
own lovely Bronzewing—the most perfect
lady’s horse, many people said, in the whole
of the Western district. The pretty creature!
I should know him from a thousand
in any scrap of moonlight—the graceful
droop and lift of his strong, supple neck,
and the way he raised his feet as he trod
the earth, that hardly seemed good enough
for him to walk on. He whisked his silky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
tail from side to side, and nibbled, and
glided from shadow to shadow, little
thinking, poor dear Bronzewing, what
was in store for him and me!</p>

<p>I wondered would daddy let me take
my horse to England? Perhaps he
would, if I made a great point of it; he
never liked to refuse me anything if he
could help it. Bronzewing was not like
poor Spring; he really <i>was</i> valuable, in
whatever part of the world he might be.
His father and mother both came from
England, to begin with. If daddy did not
mind paying all that for the parents, he
surely wouldn’t mind paying a little for
the son, who had, as he always said, all
the good points of both of them. It was
hardly a month ago that the Indian buyer
offered a hundred pounds for him, and
father would not entertain the offer for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
moment. So, feeling pretty comfortable
about Bronzewing, I began to think of
somebody else—Tom.</p>

<p>Tom was the only son of our next-door
neighbour, and lived only five miles off,
and he was my great friend. That is to
say, he had been my great friend for
years when we were children, until his
father sent him home to Oxford, and then
I did not see him for nearly four years.
He had only been back about six months,
and we had renewed our acquaintance on
rather a different footing, for now we were
both grown up. He was nearly twenty-three,
and I was just over eighteen. But
I could not say that we were not great
friends still. He brought me some presents
from Oxford when he came back—a
pretty box for my handkerchiefs, and a
book of photographs of the colleges, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
a cardinal’s hat on the cover (he was a
Christ Church man), and a set of Egyptian
jewellery that he said was the fashion in
England—and these were the greatest
treasures I had in the world.</p>

<p>I had no girl friends that I cared for.
A few young ladies lived around us, but
mother did not consider them what she
called “her sort,” and did not encourage
any intimacy between them and me. (She
was considered “stuck up” in consequence,
which did not affect her in the
slightest degree.) I seldom felt myself
tempted to disregard her prejudices, for
I don’t think they were my sort either.
I did not like girls.</p>

<p>But Tom’s father was my father’s old
friend, and his mother my mother’s
“sort” exactly, the very image of her
ideal gentlewoman, Mrs. Delany, as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
she had stepped out of Lady Llanover’s
book. And so, considering what near
neighbours we were, Tom and I were
intimate by the mere force of circumstances.</p>

<p>Did I say that his name was Smith—Tom
Smith? I am very sorry, but so
it was. He ought to have had a nobler
name to match his noble height of six feet
two and a half, and his noble, honest,
handsome face, and the noble old blood
that mother said he inherited on both
sides; but—well, he hadn’t. And, after
all, what does it matter? It is only in
novels that names are always appropriate
to the people who own them; it very
seldom is so in real life.</p>

<p>When I began to think of Tom, I
became far more melancholy than any
thought of Spring or Bronzewing had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
made me. How Tom would miss me!
And where should I find another like him,
whatever part of the world I might go to?</p>

<p>Mother was fond of contrasting the
manners of society in “her time” and in
her country with the disrespect for <i>les
convenances</i> which characterized some of
her acquaintances of later years, particularly
the young men; but I had seen
plenty of emigrant Englishmen, and not
one of them the gentleman Tom was in
all his ways, not only after he left Oxford,
but before he went there, though certainly
Oxford life did develop and polish him
wonderfully.</p>

<p>Sighing heavily, and caring no more
for the Zoological Gardens and Madame
Tussaud’s, I opened the garden gate and
went out into the paddock. Spring,
having barked himself hoarse at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
opossum, which sat serenely on an exposed
bough above him, with pointed
ears pricked up and bushy tail hanging
down, uttering a nervous little accompaniment
of growls, discharged a final volley,
and trotted after me; and, not consciously
following any route in particular, we went
towards the river, nearly a mile away,
which was threatening to dry up into a
chain of stagnant water-holes. Across the
moonlit paddock, scorched to a sandy
white; over the slip-panels in the fence,
which, of course, I never dreamed of
taking down; through a larger extent of
burnt-up meadow, where white-faced Herefords
came up to us and stared at us,
munching audibly in the still night air;
over another fence—a brush fence this
time, instead of posts and rails—through
which I scrambled where I saw a likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
place, irrespective of gates, and in which
my muslin train came to most dreadful
grief; through more paddocks, this time
sprinkled with shorn white sheep, who
scampered away from Spring in the most
abject terror, though he would have scorned
to look at them; and finally into the
shadow of the belt of gum and wattle
trees that fringed the windings of the
little river.</p>

<p>Any one who had watched me taking
such a walk at that time of night, and
especially if he or she had seen what came
of it, would certainly have accused me of
keeping clandestine appointments with
young men—a thing I would no more
dream of doing than mother herself, notwithstanding
my unfortunate ignorance of
Mrs. Grundy’s prejudices.</p>

<p>I was used to these wild rambles at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
all hours, considering my dog a sufficient
escort. I was a thorough bush
girl, as mother sadly acknowledged,
and had no fear of strange men, or horned
cattle, or snakes, or darkness, or rain,
or anything else that I know of. And
when, from under the bank of the river,
a great curly sheep dog rushed up at
us, and began to growl at Spring, the
two wagging their tails and putting
their black noses together, I was as much
surprised and dismayed as ever I was in
my life. It was Tom’s dog, as I knew in
a moment; and of course Tom followed
him up the bank to see what he was after.
He must have been pretty much astonished
too, when he saw me standing above him,
in my white dress, without a scrap of
hat on.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, what <i>are</i> you doing here?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
I cried nervously, feeling my face and
neck on fire—the first time I had ever
been affected that way by a meeting with
him.</p>

<p>“Why, Kitty, is it you?” he responded
incredulously. “What are <i>you</i> doing so
far away from home? You have nobody
with you?”</p>

<p>“No—only Spring. We were just
having a walk, and I thought, when we
were so far, I’d see if there were any ducks
in that corner where the moon shines.
Father and mother were busy talking,
and did not want me. I didn’t notice
how the time was going. I’m afraid it’s
getting very late, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Nearly nine o’clock, I should think.
Never mind; it’s a lovely night. Come
and sit on this stump a few minutes while
I set my trap, and then I’ll walk home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
with you. Do you know what I am
doing? Trying to catch some more water-rats
for you. I’ve got two hung up in
that tree. I’ve dressed thirteen skins
already—wattle-bark, and pumice-stone,
and all the proper things. You’d never
know they had not been done by a furrier;
they are as soft as wash-leather, and the
fur like silk. If you cut off the yellowish
part at the edges, and leave only the
brown, they will be plenty wide enough,
and you will have the swellest imaginable
jacket by next winter.”</p>

<p>I took his hand and scrambled down the
bank, in a happy flutter of shame and
pleasure, renewing my assurances that I
no more dreamt of seeing him there than
of seeing the bunyip itself.</p>

<p>“Of course you didn’t,” he replied
cheerfully. “But, you see, this is how it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
was: the moon got up, and as I had
been too busy all day to see after them,
it occurred to me that I might as well take
a stroll down the river and look at my
traps. And I’m very glad I did, Kitty.
I’ll never spoil a good mind again, for
fear of what I might lose by it.”</p>

<p>I sat down contentedly on my stump,
and watched him tilting up a wooden
candle-box with some sticks and a mutton
bone and a piece of string, and arranging
the primitive apparatus safely on a platform
he had prepared for it; the while he
threatened his dog, who stood over him,
with the direst penalties if he ventured to
interfere. And when I saw that he had
quite done, I got up and turned to ascend
the bank again.</p>

<p>“Stay a few minutes, Kitty,” he called
out hastily. “Now you are here you may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
as well take breath before you start all
that way home.”</p>

<p>I scouted the idea of being tired and
wanting rest; but, while I hesitated, he
held out his hand, and I turned back
again and allowed him to reseat me on
my stump. What would mother have
thought? But I could not help it.</p>

<p>“We’ll give ourselves five minutes,” he
said, turning the face of his watch to the
moonlight. “It’s just a quarter to nine,
and we’ll start at the ten minutes. Come
here, you good-for-nothing brute! Didn’t
I tell you to leave that alone?” This was
addressed to his dog. “Now then, Kitty,
what’s the news? I haven’t seen you for
more than a week, you know.”</p>

<p>He stretched himself on the bank beside
me, and took off his hat to the cool breeze.
Did he know, I wonder, how he looked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
with the moonlight on his wide brows and
his strong, straight nose, and his close-cropped
shapely brown head? Not he.
But I did; and I wondered if I should
ever see his like again, in England or any
other land.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, news!” I cried out piteously.
“There is dreadful news! Father has
really made up his mind at last to go
home.”</p>

<p>“The dickens he has!” responded Tom
under his breath, suddenly raising himself
on his elbow, and looking at me. “But I
thought that was what you had been
wishing for, Kitty, these years and
years?”</p>

<p>“So I did—so I do,” said I; “but now
it seems so near, somehow I feel it will
be a great wrench.”</p>

<p>“It will be an awful wrench to those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
you will leave behind,” said Tom; “I
know that well enough. How soon will
you go, do you think?”</p>

<p>“As soon as ever father hears that his
wool has got home safely.”</p>

<p>“Not much fear of that, I should
think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. The ship might
be wrecked, or be too late for the good
market. And sometimes wool, when it has
been packed damp, takes fire like haystacks—spontaneous
combustion, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I believe that is known to happen,
about once in a thousand years,” said Tom,
gravely; “but it couldn’t happen very
well in this case. Why, there wasn’t a
drop of rain all shearing, nor for ever
so long after.”</p>

<p>“Well, at any rate, that’s all I know.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
As soon as father is satisfied that this last
clip of wool is all right, we are to start.”</p>

<p>Tom was silent after this, and I began
to think it was time to be going home.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, Kitty. I can’t take
it all in at once. How long are you going
for? When will you be back?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we shall <i>ever</i> be back,”
I answered in a despairing tone. “Father
is going to sell everything; and I believe,
if mother once finds herself in England
again, a team of bullocks wouldn’t drag
her back.”</p>

<p>“No; a team of bullocks wouldn’t be
much good, certainly. Oh, dear me! why
didn’t you all go four or five years ago?
We could have had some fun then.”</p>

<p>“I wish we had, with all my heart,”
said I.</p>

<p>“And, I suppose,” continued Tom, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
a very grumbling tone, “as you haven’t
made your <i>début</i> in Melbourne, you’ll come
out at home; be presented at Court,
perhaps.”</p>

<p>“No, we don’t go to Court,” I replied,
with a complacent sense of dignity and
grandeur, as that mythical officer, with
whom we are all acquainted, might have
remarked of his regiment that they didn’t
dance. “Grandmamma was the last of
the family who was presented. But I
dare say I shall see a great deal of company
in my aunts’ houses.”</p>

<p>“I expect you will. I know what your
aunt Alice’s house is, for I was there
when Regy came of age. Don’t you have
anything to do with Regy, Kitty; he is
not a nice fellow.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he? I’ve always heard he was
very nice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“No, he isn’t. A good many fellows
aren’t, in the set he belongs to. Do you
know, Kitty, I’ve a good mind to sell out
too, and come home to help look after you.
You’ve got no brothers.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you’re very kind,” I retorted,
a little nettled by his disparagement of my
relations; “but I <i>have</i> a father and mother,
and they have managed to take care of me
pretty well so far. Besides, how can you
sell out? You have nothing to sell.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon. Since I came to
man’s estate the governor has made me
his partner. Half Booloomooroo belongs
to me.”</p>

<p>“But you couldn’t leave the poor old
man, and your mother. You don’t know
how she pined and moped all the time you
were at Oxford.”</p>

<p>“Poor old mother! no, of course not.
I must just grin and bear it, Kitty. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
must trust you not to forget your old
friends when you are amongst so many
new ones.”</p>

<p>“You may,” I said earnestly, touched
by something in his voice, and recovering
from my little huff in a moment. “I shall
never forget my old friends, wherever I
am. If I never see you again, Tom,
nobody in all the world”—here I stopped,
overwhelmed with horror at what I was
going to say.</p>

<p>“Finish it,” he urged, drawing himself
up to my knee, and looking eagerly in my
face—an eagerness I felt rather than saw.
“Nobody in all the world—what?”</p>

<p>“Nobody will make me forget my old
friends in Australia,” I replied hastily.
“Isn’t it going to rain, Tom? How dark
it is getting! And we must have exceeded
our five minutes long ago.”</p>

<p>“I wish you had finished that sentence,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
he remarked quietly, getting up from the
grass as I rose. “However, thank you
for the beginning, Kitty. Yes; we’d
better get back as quick as we can. I
did not notice how it was clouding over.
What a blessing rain would be!—but not
to you in that thin frock. If it comes on,
you must have my coat.”</p>

<p>We never, during all our intercourse,
said so little to one another in a given time
as during our walk home that night. I
<i>could</i> not think of anything to talk about,
and I suppose he would not; and yet the
silence seemed to shout to us. It was so
dark now, with heavy rain-clouds gathering
up, that I was glad to take his offered
hand, and be guided through the paddocks
and fences that I knew so well. In old
days we used to scramble over these latter
together, and tear our clothes in company;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
but now he opened the gates and took
down the slip panel, as if he had been
escorting mother. When we approached
the high hedges of the garden, he made
a little pause; and our dogs came and
sniffed at us, full of curiosity to know what
was going to happen next.</p>

<p>“Kitty,” said he, “shall I come in and
speak to them? Or would you rather say
good night here?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you stay all night, Tom? It
is going to be wet, and you have so far
to walk.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, Kitty, certainly not; my people
don’t know where I am. And a drop of
rain would do one good this weather.”</p>

<p>“Then, perhaps—they are very much
occupied to-night—perhaps we had better
say good night now; and I shall go in
the back way. Good night, Tom.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>My hand had lain all this time in the
warm clasp of his; now I drew it away,
without daring to wait for any more farewells.
I ran in by the back door without
looking behind me, and along the passages
to the drawing-room. Here, or rather on
the verandah outside, mother and father
were talking still; and I went to bid them
good night too, for I did not want to sit
up any longer.</p>

<p>“It’s going to rain at last, daddy,” said
I, by way of saying something.</p>

<p>“Yes, Kitty, thank God; it won’t hold
off above five minutes longer. We shall
get the tanks filled to-night, and you’ll
see the grass beginning to grow before
to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>And while I was undressing it came
down in sheets—a way it has in this part
of the world when it means to rain at all—beating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
straight into the verandah, through
the veil of vine leaves, so that even poor
Spring was driven from his door-mat, and
I had to let him in and give him the
hearthrug instead.</p>

<p>Oh, my dear love, how wet you must
have got that night!</p>

<p class="ph3">PEARS AND GREENGAGES.</p>


<p>The next day was Saturday, and mother
began to be restlessly busy—for her. She
and father had decided that nothing could
very well happen to the wool on its voyage
to London, and that, even if the prices did
fall in the market before it got there, we
could not now give up our enterprise; and
so the March mail was fixed upon as the
date of our departure, and that was not
more than six weeks off.</p>

<p>“It will be well to get home before the
summer there sets in,” said she. “Kitty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
should see England in springtime first.
Ah, Kitty, you don’t know what is in
store for you!” And she began to remind
father of the Aprils and Mays of their
early married life in Norfolk, and to talk
of hawthorn hedges and delicate leafage
of green woods, of cowslips and primroses,
cuckoos and nightingales, and so on, until
they both got quite sentimental about it.</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast was over father
went into his office and drew out his
advertisement for the Melbourne papers,
wherein he described Narraporwidgee in
the glowing terms it deserved. So-and-so
had been instructed by Harry Chamberlayne,
Esq., to sell by auction, at their
rooms, Collins Street West, on the —th
of February, 187—, at half-past two o’clock
p.m., the Narraporwidgee station, situated
so and so, and consisting of so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
thousand acres of freehold, and so many
thousand acres of Crown land, so many
sheep, cattle, horses, etc.; and when he
had done describing these matters, and all
the river frontages that he had, and all the
miles of fencing he had put up, and how
the paddocks that these enclosed were
“unsurpassed for grazing capabilities,” he
called in mother to help him to set forth
with sufficient pomp the details of the
home station—its many rooms and outbuildings,
its stores and men’s huts, its
tanks and wells, its superior woolshed and
screw press, its stables and coach-houses,
its gardens and orchards, and so on; and
it took up the best part of mother’s
morning.</p>

<p>But when this document was disposed
of, she set to work at her own preparations
with a zeal and energy that astonished me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
used as I was to her quiet ways. She
rummaged out drawers and cupboards,
turned over and sorted her household
stores, made long lists of things she had
and things she wanted, and chatted away
to me as I helped her with a subdued
vivacity that was very pleasant to see.</p>

<p>“I am not going to get you any new
dresses, Kitty,” she said, when my wardrobe
was under consideration. “You have
plenty for the voyage—the simpler they
are the better for that purpose. It does
not matter about wearing them out quickly;
as soon as we reach London you shall have
a complete outfit.” It made all seem so
near and so sudden.</p>

<p>Saturday evening was fair and clear,
with nothing to hinder the moon from
shining in all her glory. The sky had not
a cloud, and was sprinkled with pale stars,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
the Southern Cross hanging just over the
biggest of the big Portugal laurels that
father was so proud of. Already, as he
had prophesied, there was a sprinkling of
young grass blades all over everywhere
from last night’s rain, though the earth
had been looking for weeks as if it had
been skinned, so quickly does nature recover
herself in this wonderful climate.
There was a fresh scent of growth and
moisture in the soft air, which was cool
and sweet as the airs of paradise. Yet I
did not go for a walk. I had a sniff from
the verandah, while we enjoyed our after-dinner
cup of tea, and that was all.
Spring went off into the shrubberies to
indulge in the pleasures of the chase by
himself; mother sat down to begin her
English letters, though the mail did not
go out for at least ten days; and daddy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
lit his pipe, and put his hands into the
arm-holes of his waistcoat, and marched
up and down the verandah in peaceful
contemplation—conning his late literary
effort, I suppose. I, in the most unromantic
manner, made myself comfortable
in the easiest armchair, surrounded myself
with English papers and magazines, and
diligently read tales and tragedies, real
and fictitious, until it was time to go to
bed.</p>

<p>This being Saturday, naturally the next
day was Sunday; and that Sunday was
one to be evermore marked in my calendar
with the whitest of white stones. It was
lovely in respect of weather, to begin
with; not hot, and not grey or overcast;
breezy and balmy, and peaceful and spring-like.
Flowers were sprouting afresh; the
distant hill-ranges had got a new tinge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
of colour on them from the fresh-springing
verdure that was only a day old; the magpies
chattered and gabbled about the
garden more musically, I thought, than
usual—as if they, too, had fallen upon a
gala Sunday.</p>

<p>I opened my glass doors when I was
half dressed, and stood on the threshold
to brush my hair, the sweet air blowing
through it as I did so. How often I
have looked back to my little chamber
at Narraporwidgee, when cooped up in
English bedrooms, and thought of that
friendly garden walking quite up to my
door, the rose petals drifting in upon my
table, the grapes hanging at my hand
(that I used to gather and eat as I performed
my toilet), the freshness of the
morning all around me, and dear old
Spring lightly trotting over the China<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
matting, or lying in the doorway to watch
all my performances. I hate “upstairs,”
and always shall, if I live to be a hundred.</p>

<p>Never in my life did I make a Sunday
toilet with so much care and deliberation.
I was a good-looking girl enough, more
especially as to figure and carriage, about
which mother was much more particular
than she was about my complexion, which,
to be sure, had been well sunburnt; but I
do myself only justice when I say I had
never been vain of my appearance. I
never was until now. But I am not sure
that a little vanity did not come to life
that Sunday morning when I stood so long
at my looking-glass. I liked the look of
my own face, which gazed at me with
large, frank, thoughtful eyes; I liked the
look of my own hair, soft, and shiny, and
plentiful, and the colour of a pale chestnut,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
and the look of the large braids that
showed their golden ridges just over the
top of my head. I greatly admired my
own costume, which I selected more because
it was the one I liked best than
because it was the best suited to a January
morning. It was black silk, rich and
plain, fitting me beautifully. A collar of
Honiton lace and a soft ruffle adorned my
throat, and wide lace was laid, cuff fashion,
on the close sleeves, edged, too, with ruffles
round my wrists. I give this particular
description, because it was a part of the
ceremonial of the great festival day of my
life, and because it has been the type of
costume that I have worn—to please somebody—ever
since.</p>

<p>Mother looked at me approvingly when
I came in to breakfast. The rich old lace
had been hers, and she loved it; and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
loved the style of that simple but costly
gown. She was pleased whenever she
saw what she considered signs of taste in
her colonial girl, who in earlier days had
been too fond of many colours.</p>

<p>“You needn’t hack <i>that</i> dress, dear,”
she said, as she kissed me. “You can
wear that quite well when you get home.
Still, it is a cool morning and you look
very nice; doesn’t she, daddy?”</p>

<p>“She always looks nice,” replied daddy,
as he helped me to a chop; but that was
more of a compliment than she bargained
for.</p>

<p>Breakfast was a late meal on Sunday
mornings, and as soon as breakfast was
over it was time to get ready for church.
Father went to order the horses, and to see
them put in also, for like most Australian
country gentlemen, he would have thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
himself very remiss if he did not personally
test his buckles and straps and the
bolts of his buggy before starting with
ladies over bush roads. Mother and I
went to dress, which, with me, was a
matter of hat and gloves, and then there
was a grand gathering of the household.
The waggonette was roomy, and took
all the womankind on the station who
wished to attend church—their respective
churches, that is, for we had no female
servant just now belonging to our own
communion, except the laundress, who was
laid up “very bad with the rheumatics”—all
the fault of that “dreadful night” on
Friday, the wicked old creature said—tempting
Providence, I told her. Mother
took her seat of honour by father’s side,
and I, two house servants, and the overseer’s
daughter, disposed ourselves behind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
and I took care to sit by the door, where I
could see the road behind us.</p>

<p>“All aboard?” shouted father impatiently.
“Give ’em their heads, Joe.”
Joe sprang back, and the horses, finding
themselves free, wriggled for a second,
gave two great bounds, and darted out of
the yard and into the paddock as if they
had wings to their heels.</p>

<p>When English people talk about good
driving, with their perfectly broken-in
horses, and their level, even roads, and
all that elaboration of harness, I simply
turn up my nose. Give a man a pair of
bush horses like those two of ours, who
that very Sunday had their collars on for
the sixth or eighth time, and not a bit of
a strap behind their slender girth-pads,
and see how he would take them through
trees and stumps, and ruts and holes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
creeks and gullies, and ten or fifteen gates.
It was beautiful to see how father did it.</p>

<p>We lived nine miles away from the
church, and we got there in less than an
hour. The bell (which hung from a limb
of a tall gum tree in the churchyard) was
just beginning to ring, at the instance of a
lank lad, who was also the superintendent
of the Sunday-school; and the congregation
was assembling at its leisure, after the
manner of country congregations.</p>

<p>Mother went into the parsonage to see
the clergyman’s young wife, who had just
had her first baby; father drove into the
little enclosure set apart for the safe keeping
of buggies and horses during service time,
took out his fiery pair and hung them up
at the fence; and I sedately walked into
church. The choir, to which I had the
honour to belong, of course sat in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
wrong place—close by the entrance door;
and here I settled myself, as yet all alone
in my glory, in the corner seat that belonged
to me, to watch the people coming
into church.</p>

<p>I had not watched long, and the little
building was filling rapidly (the people
being in the habit of hanging about outside
to talk to one another till the last
moment, and then all flocking in at once),
when I heard the sound of light wheels
and fast-trotting horses, and my heart
began to beat in a hurry.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Smith came in first, the
portly old man with his silver head, and
the fine-featured, slender old lady, who was
so like Mrs. Delany of a hundred years ago.
She was quite unlike anybody I had ever
seen. She never wore anything but old
brocades and soft black satins, and scraps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
and lappets of old ivory-coloured lace, with
a China crape shawl in summer and a thick
black silk mantle or sable cape in winter.
Beside the many-coloured fourth and fifth-rate
fashionables who sat around her in
church, she looked most queerly ancient
and picturesque.</p>

<p>I used to wonder where she could have
got her clothes from, until mother told me
they were the carefully hoarded remnants
of a mighty wardrobe that she had had
when she was a belle of fashion at some
foreign court. Mr. Smith was her second
husband, whom she had married rather
late in life, and, it was said, under very
romantic circumstances. My Tom was
their only son.</p>

<p>He came in five minutes after service
had begun, for he had stayed behind to
take out his horses, and he made his way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
at once to a vacant seat beside me, to my
extreme content and embarrassment. He
also was a member of the choir, and in our
primitive congregation it did not matter
how the voices were mixed up, provided
enough of them were there. Anybody sat
where anybody liked. We didn’t speak
to one another, of course, as service was
going on, and we didn’t want to speak.
Two giggling young dressmakers’ apprentices
sat behind us, whispering comments
upon my dress and hat—very sharply on
the look-out, I have no doubt, for any communication
that might take place between
us. He had forgotten his hymn-book, and
had to look over mine; but, what with
those girls behind us, and the lady who
played the harmonium, as <i>locum tenens</i> for
the clergyman’s wife, making a dreadful
mess of it, I was enabled to sing loudly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
and steadily, and to comport myself
generally with dignity and composure.
But I must say I had a sensation of flurry
within me that I was not by any means
used to.</p>

<p>When the service was over, and we who
had buggies were congregated around
them, mother and father gave their regular
Sunday invitation to Mr. and Mrs. Smith,
which they regularly accepted, to lunch
with us on their way home. Their way
was the same as ours almost up to the
garden gate, and then they had between
six and seven miles (by the road) further
to go. We always reached home at reasonable
lunch time, and they could not;
and each of the small households enjoyed
the weekly intercourse with the other, so
that it had become quite an institution.
The invitation was offered and accepted
just for polite form’s sake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>As we were getting into our respective
buggies Tom suggested that I might as
well go with them as sit alone behind (we
had to pick up our servants as we went
along). I looked at mother, who said,
“Certainly, dear, if you wish,” and then
climbed to the high box-seat by Tom’s
side, quite careless how I wiped the wheels
with my lustrous skirts, and we led the
way out into the village street.</p>

<p>“I say, didn’t it pelt, Kitty, that
night?” said Tom, presently, when I had
exchanged some remarks with his parents,
and we were sitting in silence, side by
side. “It’s well you got in when you
did.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, Tom; and how I wished you
had stayed with us! Did you not get
awfully, dreadfully drenched?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. That is, of course I got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
wet, but I’m not made of sugar. It takes
more than that to affect me. I rather
liked it. Will you have another walk to-night,
Kitty? There will be no end of a
moon after this fine day, and we needn’t
go home till we like. Mother”—turning
his face over his shoulder—“you can have
a spell of gossip to-day, for there’ll be a
lovely moon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, we mustn’t be late,” responded
Mrs. Smith, earnestly. But Tom
smiled at me, and showed no alarm at
the threat. “Soon you won’t have Mrs.
Chamberlayne to talk to,” said he; “you
must remember that.”</p>

<p>When we reached home luncheon was
ready, and we discussed it at great leisure,
with much conversation, as was the rule
on Sundays; for on that day it was dinner
into the bargain. On this special occasion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
I would be afraid to say how long we
were about it. I know it was nearly four
o’clock before father rolled up his napkin
and proposed an adjournment to the
verandah for dessert. When we got out of
the house, we cast about for freedom, Tom
and I, and obtained it without any trouble.</p>

<p>“Kitty,” said father, “go into the
orchard and see how those pears are
getting on.”</p>

<p>“Pears, daddy!” replied I. “Why, of
course they are as hard as nails, and will
be for I don’t know how long.”</p>

<p>“Well, greengages, then—they’re ripe,
aren’t they? Take a basket and see if
you can find a dishful for tea. I always
think”—turning to Mrs. Smith—“that
fruit is never so nice as when freshly
gathered off the tree and put on green
leaves, as Kitty does it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“Come along, Kitty,” said Tom; “we’ll
get a choice assortment of whatever’s
going.”</p>

<p>Here poor mother, who foresaw that I
might probably tear myself to rags, interfered
to bid me go and change my dress
first. This I did, with no loss of time;
and then we two went away to the orchard,
leaving our elders to sip their wine
and gossip, and, I dare say, to become quite
oblivious of our existence.</p>

<p>“I really think father wanted to get rid
of us,” said I, as soon as we were out of
earshot.</p>

<p>“I dare say he did, and very kind of
him, I’m sure. I suppose they want to
talk over all this going to England business.
Are you still sorry you are going,
Kitty?”</p>

<p>“For some things,” I replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“What things?”</p>

<p>I hesitated, and then said vaguely,
“Lots of things.”</p>

<p>We reached the orchard, and sauntered
silently to a remote shady corner, where,
under a huge apple tree, stood a low rustic
seat.</p>

<p>“Let’s sit down a bit, Kitty; it’s too
soon after dinner for you to go rampaging
about, making yourself hot. They don’t
want the fruit till tea-time, and that won’t
be for hours yet.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t believe the greengages are
ripe any more than the pears,” I said; “we
have not had one yet. There might be a
few raspberries and some apricots left.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see presently. It is so
jolly sitting here all by ourselves. You
don’t know how I have been longing to
see you again, ever since Friday night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
when you ran away from me without
saying good-bye.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did. It was my lucky star
brought you down to the river on Friday
night, Kitty.”</p>

<p>“You might have got rheumatic fever,
and been a cripple all your days, or died,”
I responded gravely. “People do sometimes,
when they get such a drenching as
you must have had.”</p>

<p>“Not when they are as strong and
sound as I am, and if they have sense
enough to take their wet clothes off at
once and have a stiff glass of brandy and
water. Indeed, I think it did me all the
good in the world; I wanted a little
cooling down.”</p>

<p>I had no comment to offer upon that
speech, except a rising colour in my face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
that I would have given much to have had
cooled down. So Tom went on. “Tell
me some of the things that make you wish
you were not going to England, Kitty.”</p>

<p>“Many things—nothing in particular, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“There are things you don’t want to
leave?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And people?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Whom will you miss most? You are
not intimate with many people, Kitty.
You have very few friends indeed, for a
girl of your age.”</p>

<p>“Yes, very few. I don’t think I like
girls.”</p>

<p>He was silent a minute, looking at me,
and then he said, “Are there many people
you will miss more than me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“No,” I answered nervously; “how
could there be, when there are only a few
altogether? Don’t go on catechizing,
Tom; talk of something. Tell me about
England.”</p>

<p>“Any one?” he persisted, now looking
very grave and eager, and leaning his arm
on his knee to see more clearly into my
face.</p>

<p>I had to tell the truth. I looked up at
a green apple hanging before me, staring
with misty eyes, as if I were having my
photograph taken. I replied as steadily as
I could, “Not any one that I know of.”</p>

<p>“One question more, Kitty, and you’ll
bless my impudence for asking it, I dare
say, but I won’t bother you any more.
Are you sorry you are going, because of
leaving me?”</p>

<p>I did not bless his impudence. I looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
into his dear, handsome, eager face, and
thought of all that leaving him would cost
me, and how blank and empty England
would be, if there were untold millions of
men in it; and—I am ashamed to say it,
though I could not help it any more than
I could help being dumb to express my
sentiments in any other way—I put my
hands to my face and began to cry. I
need not say what happened after that.
In an instant hands and face were hidden
in his breast, and his own strong hands
were clasped closely over them. It was
only what I might have expected.</p>

<p>“My love! My pretty Kitty! Bless
you, my darling!” he exclaimed in a
strong passion of emotion that went over
me like a tidal wave; and he kissed the
top of my head in a way that made my
very toes tingle. “Why need we be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
separated, my own dear love? If you
want me I will come—or I will wait and
come—or I will keep you back. Somehow—some
way—I will manage that we shall
not lose one another. <i>Do</i> you want me,
Kitty?”</p>

<p>“Do you want <i>me</i>?” I whispered, lifting
my head a little, without drawing it away.
“That is the question.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I shown you that? Why,
before I went away, when you were ever
such a little thing, all the time I was at
Oxford, every day since I came home—dreadfully
ever since I came home—I have
wanted you. You would have broken my
heart on Friday night with that news you
brought me, only somehow—you won’t
mind my saying so now, Kitty?—somehow
I had a feeling that it would all come
right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>“I oughtn’t to have let you feel so,
Tom.”</p>

<p>“Yes; you couldn’t help it. And now
it has come right I’m the happiest dog in
the wide world. Aren’t you happy yourself,
now?”</p>

<p>“I am, I am!” I replied heartily (for
why should I have tried to hide it?); and I
put up one timid and hand laid it on his
shoulder. And then he clasped me close,
and we took a long, long, long kiss, with
scorching faces and loud-beating hearts.
And we never thought anything more
about pears and greengages until the tea-bell
rang, and it was too late even to think
of looking for them.</p>

<p class="ph3">ARCADIA.</p>


<p>“What shall we do now, Kitty?” said
Tom, as we hastened through the orchard,
hand in hand, with our empty basket.
“Shall I call your father away after tea
and speak to him? Or shall we keep the
rest of this one day for ourselves, and have
a walk to the river in the moonlight? Do
you think it would be wrong to have a
clandestine engagement, just under their
noses, until to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” I replied emphatically.
“It would be much the nicest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“Much—there’s no doubt about <i>that</i>.
And, after all, nobody can tell what may
happen after to-day. Suppose he won’t
give his consent, Kitty?”</p>

<p>“He’s too kind,” I said promptly.
“And he can’t bear to see me miserable.”</p>

<p>“Not even for your good?”</p>

<p>“No, not even for my good. Mother
would make me miserable for my good,
though she would be a deal worse herself
all the time; she has the will and the
courage, somehow. But poor dear daddy
breaks down the moment he sees me
even getting ready to cry. I’m more
afraid of mother than I am of him. But
oh, Tom, what is there to be afraid of?
What could any one see in you to object
to?”</p>

<p>We were by this time in the back
passage, and, doors being closed, stopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
to exchange another kiss; and then we
sneaked into the dining-room, one after
the other, reversing the order of precedence
in consideration of my nerves.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Kitty,” said father, looking
round the table, which was garnished with
a veal pie and some chicken salad, “where
are the plums gone to?”</p>

<p>“There are none ripe, daddy,” faltered I.</p>

<p>“And couldn’t you find any substitute?
You might have picked a dish of apricots,
at any rate. It doesn’t seem natural to
have tea on Sundays without fruit of some
sort.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there are any apricots
left,” I suggested, beginning to be uncomfortably
conscious that mother was
regarding me gravely from the corner of
her eye.</p>

<p>“None left?” father almost shouted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
“Why, didn’t you see Sandy, only yesterday,
carrying off a wheelbarrow load for
the pigs?”</p>

<p>I hung my head, and mother came to
the rescue. “The rain spoiled them,” she
put in quietly. I was certain, from the
tone of her voice, that she scented the
truth, though, perhaps, afar off; and I
quaked inwardly.</p>

<p>As soon as tea was over, I slipped out
of the room and into my bedroom, whence
I emerged from my private door into the
garden, and ran away to the paddock. In
about ten minutes I spied Tom poking
about the shrubbery, looking for me; and
I called “Cooee!” once or twice, softly,
to bring him to my hiding-place.</p>

<p>“I wondered where in the world you
were off to,” he said in some surprise.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you why I ran away,” I eagerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
responded. “I felt certain mother would
ask me to sing, or to do something that
would keep me indoors; and I could not
bear to lose this one evening of our own.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed; that <i>would</i> have been hard
lines, and no mistake! Ah, well, we’ll
soon settle with them, and get our liberty
honestly, please God.”</p>

<p>“We’re not dishonest, Tom, I hope.”</p>

<p>“No, my darling, no; but you know
what I mean.”</p>

<p>I did know what he meant, of course.
And I slipped my hand in his and we set
off across the moonlit grass, with Spring
bounding wildly after us. I dare say there
were plenty more lovers in the world as
happy as we, but we did not think so.</p>

<p>We made our way to the very bend of
the river where I met him on Friday
night, and sat down on the very identical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
stump. That is to say, I sat down on it,
and he sat as close to me as circumstances
permitted, in a very comfortable, if slightly
ungraceful attitude. There were some wild
ducks dotting the moonlight in the deep
pool above us—if it had been a week-night
they never would have swum about in that
confidential way; and a pair of ridiculous
laughing jackasses sat over our heads and
jeered at us.</p>

<p>“Oh, Kitty, Kitty, how many nights
like this shall we have, I wonder, out of
six weeks of nights! What a dreadful
little time it is!”</p>

<p>“Hush now, Tom. Don’t let us talk of
anything but what is nice and pleasant.
The other things can wait.”</p>

<p>“All right, we won’t. Kitty, when we
are married, you must always wear black
gowns with white lace on them, like that
one you had on this morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>“Did you like it?”</p>

<p>“I should think so, rather. I never saw
you in anything that suited you so well.”</p>

<p>“And it happens to be the dress that <i>I</i>
like best. But oh, Tom, I should cost a
fortune if I wore that sort of thing always?
You can’t think how unlucky I am with
my clothes, and how soon I make them
shabby. I have a knack of catching on
all the nails and knobs and things that
stick out, somehow.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can have a change sometimes,
of course; but that is what you must wear
whenever you want to be particularly
swell.”</p>

<p>“I’m quite agreeable. Only you must
make me a rather considerable allowance, I
must tell you.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe in allowances. I
shall give you a cheque-book of your own,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
and you shall draw whatever you want,
without being beholden to anybody. There
should be no bargaining between husband
and wife.”</p>

<p>“If husbands did like that, Tom, I’m
afraid the wives would get dreadfully demoralized.
Why, I can’t add up money at all—I
don’t know why, but I never could—and
I should very likely ruin you without
knowing it.”</p>

<p>“How jolly it will be!” murmured Tom,
meditatively.</p>

<p>“Being ruined?”</p>

<p>“No, being a husband, and having a
wife. I suppose I shall come to England
for you and we shall be married there.
Mind now, Kitty, lots of men will want
to make love to you when you get home
and into society. Don’t you let them,
there’s a good girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter what they do, I suppose,
if <i>I</i> don’t make love to <i>them</i>.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it, though, by Jove! when I’m
not there to send them about their business!
Do you know, I’m sorry you haven’t
been out and got all that over. I should
like to feel you had chosen me out of the
whole world, as I have chosen you.”</p>

<p>“And pray haven’t I? We’ll wait, if
you like, and not be engaged until I have
gone through two or three London seasons—if
mother lets me have London seasons,
that is. I am quite ready.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not, Kitty; and you know
that is nonsense. But oh, how long the
time will be till I can come after you!”</p>

<p>“To keep me out of mischief—as you
said the other night.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did—though not in so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
words, perhaps. Now, don’t be a suspicious,
jealous, disagreeable boy. If you can’t
trust me out of sight, I’m not worth
having. And I promise you <i>faithfully</i>,
Tom—I’m not afraid to take any ‘solemn
davy’ you like—that a hundred thousand
million men won’t make any more difference
in my love for you than if they
weren’t there.”</p>

<p>Tom wriggled a little closer, and laid
his head upon my shoulder; and Spring,
for the first time catching sight of ducks,
sent them with a sudden splash whirring
up through the moonlight over our heads.
We neither of us spoke for a little while,
but held one another close, and sealed that
sacred compact with a long and solemn
kiss. We suddenly seemed to feel it a
sort of sacrilege to talk. We looked up
together at the delicate sky and the pale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
stars, the tip of his auburn moustache
brushing my cheek the while, and watched
the flight of the wild-fowl until they were
out of sight—one after another, all in line,
like the ducks in Landseer’s “Sanctuary,”
their black necks stretched out, and their
active little pinions twinkling. It was a
sweeter night than Friday night had been.
The river was not low and stagnant now,
with dry mud-banks, but rippling and
brawling over its stones and snags, almost
to our feet, fed anew with a freshet coming
down from the Booloomooroo Ranges,
where we had seen it raining in the
afternoon. There were faint tints of dying
daylight tingeing the moonshine that lay
around us; and there were soft airs,
fragrant with the scent of the refreshed
earth and the springing grass, just breathing
into our faces like the breath of life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
itself. No such airs ever blow in England,
I think. Even the gum trees, ugly as
they were—so far as Nature’s works
<i>can</i> be ugly—were transfigured in this
light, rustling their scraggy and shadeless
branches softly, and throwing patterns on
my white gown.</p>

<p>I was the first to break the spell of
happy silence in which we sat. “Tom,”
I said, “when will you come to England
for me?”</p>

<p>“As soon as I can, my darling; you
may be sure of that. I must talk to my
father about it, and hear what Mr. Chamberlayne
says.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you persuade Mr. Smith to sell
out, as father is doing, and settle in England,
too?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there is any chance of
that. You see, my mother is not like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
yours; <i>she</i> hates England, and wouldn’t
go back there for anything.”</p>

<p>“What an odd thing! And yet she
never seems to have belonged to the colony
a bit.”</p>

<p>“No more she does. But something—some
dreadful trouble, I think—happened
to her at home. I don’t know what it
was; it was long ago—when she was
married before; or, at any rate, before
she married my father. I know the
governor came out and invested everything
they both had in the colony, to
please her. Moreover, she has chosen the
place where she wants to be buried—in
that open space in the clump of wattles at
the bottom of the garden. She is going to
have an iron railing put round it; she
drew the design herself. That looks as
if she had made up her mind never to
go away again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>“And she never told you what happened
to make her exile herself in that
way?”</p>

<p>“Never: she has plenty to say about
most things, as you know; but if you once
approach an allusion to her early life she
is as mum as anything—shuts up like a
box. Do you remember that mysterious
party in Lady Georgiana Fullerton’s novel
‘Too Strange not to be True?’ I often
think she is like her.”</p>

<p>“But of course your father knows all
about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, of course he knows. But he
never lets anything out any more than she
does. I have been a little inquisitive
sometimes, and asked him questions; but
it always worried him awfully, poor old
boy, so I gave it up. But I’m quite sure
that here they will both stay—as long as
she lives, at any rate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“Then what will you do, Tom?”—very
sorrowfully. “You are their only child,
and it would break their hearts to part
with you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I must not leave them for long.
I must just run home to get married, and
bring you back with me, Kitty. I hope it
won’t be very hard on you, dear. We’ll
have a house in Melbourne for part of the
year, if you like; I won’t keep you always
in the bush. And when the poor old
people are gone, then we’ll live in any
part of the world you like best. <i>I</i> don’t
care a pin for the colony except for their
sakes.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t care a pin where I live,”
I responded, “so long as we are together.”</p>

<p>So we talked and talked, until it suddenly
occurred to us that Mr. and Mrs.
Smith might be wanting to go home, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
would have no idea where their young
coachman was gone to. Then we scrambled
from our nest in the green bank,
called Spring, who had forgotten it was
Sunday, from his very secular engagements,
and set off, hand in hand, through
our Champs Elysées—oh, so loth to be convinced
that our happy day was so nearly
at an end!</p>

<p>When we reached home, we saw the
Smith’s buggy with the hood up, standing
ready in the stable yard, and Joe at the
horses’ heads. In the drawing-room our
elders, with the exception of Mrs. Smith,
were standing about; and she was sitting
on a sofa, in her old poke bonnet and her
lovely old Indian shawl, with gloved
hands folded before her, looking as if she
might have been waiting any number of
hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>“I hope I am not behind time,” began
Tom (he would no more have put his
mother to inconvenience than he would
the Queen, if he could help it). “I thought
you would want a good long talk with
Mrs. Chamberlayne, as there are so few
Sundays left.”</p>

<p><i>My</i> mother, who had evidently been on
the watch for my approach, laid her hand
upon my shoulder, and said gravely, “My
dear, where have you been? I greatly
dislike your running about in this way so
late at night.”</p>

<p>“Don’t blame Kitty,” put in Tom, turning
quickly to defend me; “it was my fault,
Mrs. Chamberlayne. The night was so
lovely that I persuaded her to come out for
a walk.” And then I suppose he thought
it was time to “settle with them,” as he
called it; for he drew father a little aside,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
and asked him if he would be disengaged
any time the following day, as he wanted
particularly to speak to him.</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly, my dear boy,”
replied father, in blissful ignorance. “Any
time after lunch that you like. You’d
better come to lunch, eh?”</p>

<p>“I’ll come at three o’clock, or thereabouts,”
said Tom, “if that will be convenient
to you.”</p>

<p>And then they all went out to the
buggy, father leading the way with Mrs.
Smith, and mother monopolizing <i>both</i> the
remaining men. I trailed after them at a
respectful distance, waiting for an opportunity
to say good night.</p>

<p>With the reins in one hand, Tom turned
back and held out the other to me, before
mounting into his seat. “Good night,
Kitty,” he said aloud; and then, stooping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
his tall head, he whispered hurriedly,
“Look out for me when I leave the presence-chamber
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“No fear,” I replied promptly. And I
was very thankful, as soon as I had made
use of that vulgar expression, that mother
had not been near enough to hear it. My
feelings were too strong for me, and it
slipped out unawares.</p>

<p class="ph3">DESPAIR.</p>


<p>Mother had a suspicion of what was going
on, but she held her tongue and made no
sign. She kissed me as usual when I went
to bed, and when I got up in the morning,
and then went about her preparations as
busily as before. Father was silent and
preoccupied, and extremely affectionate
and gentle to me, and his manner led
me to believe that she had given him an
idea of what Tom was probably coming
for, and that he was thinking about it.
But I dared not say or do anything to
provoke him to disclose his thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>Luncheon was late to-day for some
reason, and we did not rise from table
until nearly three o’clock. As soon as I
could escape, I went to my own room and
locked the door, and tried to straighten my
somewhat untidy drawers and cupboards,
while I impatiently waited to know my
fate. I heard Tom open and shut the
gate, and heard his long stride over the
gravel, his leap up the verandah steps, and
his peculiar authoritative knock at the
front door. I heard Bridget ask him into
the drawing-room; I heard father go in
after him and close the door; and, two
minutes later, mother’s dress rustled up
the hall, and she, too, followed them, and
softly shut herself in. I left the door of
my wardrobe open, with all manner of
garments tumbling off the shelves; and I
flung myself on my knees by the bedside,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
and prayed that things might be permitted
to go well for us—by which I meant, of
course, the way we wanted them to go.</p>

<p>I stayed on my knees I can’t tell how
long, after my prayer was done, listening;
and I heard no sound. Then I got up,
washed my face and hands, and raged
round and round the room, making handcuffs
of the towel. Then I stole into the
passage; then I stole back again; and
then I snatched up my hat, and ran out
through the garden into the paddock,
where I took up my post under an overhanging
acacia hedge to wait for my
lover’s coming. I sat here so long that
I was afraid I had missed him, which
dreadful thought prompted me to run back,
post haste, to the house. Meeting Bridget
in a passage, I breathlessly inquired if
Mr. Smith was gone; and Bridget smirked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
in a confidential manner, and said, “No,
miss, not yet.” Whereupon I again shut
myself into my bedroom, with the door
ajar, and felt that if this sort of thing
went on much longer I should have to
invade the presence-chamber myself.</p>

<p>At last mother came out, and, by the
sound of her dress, I knew she was approaching
my citadel. I held my breath
while she paused and tapped at the door.
“Kitty, my dear, are you here?”</p>

<p>I flung out of the room then, and threw
myself into her arms. “Oh, mother,
mother, tell me! What does father say?”
I cried, with almost hysterical excitement.
“Is it all right for Tom and me?”</p>

<p>“Tom has asked to be allowed to tell
you about it himself,” she replied gently,
but with a tremor in her voice. “You
may go to him, Kitty; he is in the drawing-room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
waiting for you. I can trust
you both.”</p>

<p>“Trust us!” I echoed, puzzled at the
bare idea of such a thing.</p>

<p>“My dear,” mother went on, very
earnestly and lovingly, with an appealing
look in her soft eyes, “if you don’t find
things quite as you wish, you must remember
that your father and I have done
what is best for you. We know what is
good for you better than you can know
yourself.” A vague chill struck me as she
spoke, and I begged her to tell me, in plain
words, what had been settled.</p>

<p>“No; go and talk to Tom,” she said;
“he will explain everything. I will give
you half an hour to yourselves.”</p>

<p>I broke away from her at once, and ran
to the drawing-room, and shut the door
after me. Tom was standing with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
back to a table, and supporting himself on
it, with his hands behind him, gazing out
of the window with such a sad and
thoughtful look in his face as I had never
seen before. He turned when he heard
me, and I ran into his arms and laid my
head on his shoulder, passionately determined
that nothing should ever part us,
if <i>I</i> could help it.</p>

<p>“Well, Kitty,” he said, stroking my
hair, “we have half an hour of our own.
Let us make the most of it, for it is the
last we shall get.”</p>

<p>“What has happened? What have they
done?” I cried piteously.</p>

<p>“They have driven a hard bargain with
us, dear; but we must submit to it, as
it is for your sake. We are not to be
engaged, Kitty, for a couple of years at the
least, until you have been ‘out,’ and have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
seen the world a little. Your father thinks
you have taken to me because there was
no one else, perhaps, and that you are too
young to know your own mind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what nonsense! Why didn’t you
tell them different, Tom?”</p>

<p>“My love, I did all I could to keep you,
you may be quite sure. But fathers and
mothers are hard to deal with in these
matters. I couldn’t talk them over; they
had made up their minds.”</p>

<p>Tears began to fill my eyes—tears of
indignation, as well as of bitter disappointment
and grief. “But they didn’t say
we were <i>never</i> to have one another, did
they?” I inquired, searching for a ray of
hope.</p>

<p>“No, Kitty, thank goodness! They had
no objection to me personally——”</p>

<p>“I should think not, indeed! I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
know what they want, if you’re not good
enough—the Prince of Wales, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“The Prince of Wales is married
already, Kitty; and I don’t think he
would make you a better husband than
I should, if he weren’t. No, I may have
my chance, like any other man, only I
must wait all this awful long time for it.
How I shall do it, goodness only knows!”</p>

<p>“You may come home in two years,
then, and we may be properly engaged?”</p>

<p>“Yes; if you are in the same mind,
Kitty, and have not forgotten my existence.
No fear of <i>my</i> not coming to claim
the only privilege I could get out of
them.”</p>

<p>“But, don’t you see, Tom, it comes to
much the same thing after all. Fortunately,
we understood one another before
they knew anything about it, and we can’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
undo <i>that</i>. We <i>are</i> engaged between ourselves,
and we know in our own hearts
that we could never give one another up.
Of course we can submit quietly—outwardly,
you know. Indeed, we have no
choice in the matter, it appears; we <i>must</i>
submit. I need not wear any ring, and
I wouldn’t talk about you, or anything
of that sort; but we can write to one
another, and that will be a comfort. I will
buy a quantity of the thinnest foreign
paper that is made, and the finest steel
pens, and keep a sort of diary for you of
everything that happens, to post every
mail; and you can do the same.”</p>

<p>“But, Kitty——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, don’t let us mind! It would
have been worse if you had gone to father
<i>first</i>, and he had forbidden you to propose
to me. We must have been quite parted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
then, for, of course, I couldn’t have written
to you. But now the mail every month
will be something to look forward to,
though the months will seem like years.
And we shall always have the feeling of
<i>knowing</i> that we belong to each other,
whatever happens.” Tom sat down on a
sofa near us, and drew me into his arms.
There was a solemnity in the way he did
it that made me stop talking.</p>

<p>“My darling,” he said, sorrowfully,
smoothing my hair in that tender way
he had, “you don’t know the worst of it.
They have put me upon my honour not
to bind you in any way.”</p>

<p>“I bind myself,” I replied shortly.</p>

<p>“I’m not to allow you to be engaged,
in <i>any</i> sense, Kitty.”</p>

<p>“But if I choose to consider myself so,
that is my own business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I only hope that you will consider
yourself so, and keep yourself for me.
That is all I shall have to live on, Kitty,
remember that. But in the mean time—in
the mean time we have to do just exactly
as if we were utter strangers.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean we are not to write?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. I begged and prayed for
half an hour, I should think, that we
might be allowed to write sometimes, but
your mother was more inexorable about
that than about anything else. She said—and
quite truly, of course—that it would
be an admission of an engagement between
us, and hinder you from having perfect
freedom.”</p>

<p>“What do I want with perfect freedom?
What does mother know about it, dictating
to us like that? Why are we to be treated
so—as if we were two babies?” I cried,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
in a passion of anger and grief. “You
had no business to give in to her, Tom.
If you really wanted to keep me you
ought to have stood out against such
tyranny.”</p>

<p>There was an ominous pause, during
which I repented myself of this outburst.
“Kitty,” he said at last, in a grave,
shocked voice that chilled my heart, “that
is the hardest thing I have had to bear
to-day.”</p>

<p>“I did not mean to say it, Tom; I did
not think before I spoke! I know you
did your best for us both,” I sobbed,
dreadfully sorry to have hurt him, and
beginning to feel quite broken down under
such an accumulation of misfortunes. “Oh,
Tom, what shall we do? what shall we
do? How shall I live for two years without
knowing whether you are alive or dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
even?” Two years at my time of life was
tantamount to for ever.</p>

<p>“You shall know that, at any rate,” he
replied, rousing himself to comfort me.
“And the time will not be so long as
you think, especially as it will be so filled
up in England. We shan’t be grey-haired
or decrepid when we meet again. After
all, you won’t be twenty-one.”</p>

<p>I went on crying in silence; I could
not stop yet now I had fairly begun. Tom
laid my head on his breast, and laid his
cheek on my head, and then let me alone
for a while that I might have it out.
Presently he said, “What’s the day of the
month, Kitty?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” I whined dismally.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you; it’s my birthday.
All this business put it out of my head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
and I forgot to mention it before. It is
my twenty-fourth birthday. Now, cheer
up, dear, and listen to me. On this day
two years—the day I am twenty-six—I’ll
meet you in England, wherever you are.
When you get up in the morning, you
may feel sure you will meet me somewhere
before night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, what a happy day! but it
will never, never come. I might be dead—we
might both be dead—before that.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk of such dreadful things,
child; don’t make matters worse than they
are. Let us trust one another, and trust
in God to keep us safely till we meet again.
Let us look forward to that day, Kitty.
Nothing shall hinder me from coming to
you, unless my father or mother should
be ill, or anything should happen, of
course, which it would be <i>quite impossible</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
to help. Only sheer force shall keep me
from you, after the time when our two
years are up.”</p>

<p>“But if you should be kept, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I shall provide for that possible,
though most improbable, contingency, by
writing to you beforehand, under cover
to your father, and asking him to give
you the letter at night, if I have not
turned up during the day. He has trusted
me, and I can trust him.”</p>

<p>Here our conversation was interrupted
by a knock at the door, and it struck us
simultaneously that we must have much
exceeded our half-hour.</p>

<p>“Yes?” interrogated Tom loudly.</p>

<p>“I want you, Kitty,” replied mother’s
low, clear voice; and we rose from the
sofa together, and stood clasped in each
other’s arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“God bless you, my own dear love,” he
whispered, as I received his parting kiss
in floods of tears. “Remember, you are
no longer bound to me, except by your
love.”</p>

<p>“I shall be bound by that always, Tom;
and you must never believe anything else,
whatever people may tell you. Come for
me on your birthday, and you will find me
ready for you.”</p>

<p>“I will—I will! And now I must go,
darling—I will go out by the verandah,
for I can’t see anybody else just now.
Apologize to your mother for me.”</p>

<p>“And what about to-morrow, Tom, and
next day, and all the time till we go?”</p>

<p>“We shall meet sometimes, I suppose,
Kitty, but we must not have any walks by
ourselves any more.”</p>

<p>Mother’s knock came again, more peremptory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
than before, and we had to tear ourselves
apart. Tom got his hat and went
out by the window, a sadder man than he
had been when he came, poor fellow; and
I opened the door and flounced past mother,
with flashing eyes and my nose in the air,
and, regaining the shelter of my own
chamber, flung myself on my bed, and
cried as if my heart would break.</p>

<p class="ph3">TOM SMITH’S FAMILY DIAMONDS.</p>


<p>I have often felt very sorry, and very
much ashamed of myself, when I have
thought of the way I treated my father
and mother—particularly mother—at this
time. I seldom spoke to either of them;
and when I did, without being exactly
impertinent, I contrived to frame my
remarks in as unpleasant a form as possible,
so that they might get no satisfaction out
of them. I showed them no tender observances,
beyond the regulation kiss
morning and night, into which I infused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
as much indifference and formality as I
decently could. I sat at table during
meals with my head poised proudly in the
air, and studiously refrained from smiling
when father made his little jokes, and
from gratifying mother by the slightest
appearance of interest when she chattered
of her English preparations and plans. I
was too proud to be pettish, and tell her
that I wished, as Caddy Jellaby did about
America, that England was dead, which
would have expressed my sentiments
clearly in a simple form; but by a disparaging
silence, or an implied disbelief
in the infallible accuracy of her memory,
or an ostentatious display of colonial prejudices,
I did what in me lay, with considerable
ingenuity, to take the flavour out
of all her pleasant anticipations. They
knew what it meant as well as I did, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
they bore it with a patient gentleness that
I do not now like to think of. Only when
my ill-temper betrayed me into ill-manners,
mother brought me to my senses with her
customary directness; but they took all
my covert slights with such a delicate
forbearance that they would not even let
me see that they noticed them. What
hurt them most, I am sure, was my refusal
to be talked to and reasoned with respecting
the condition of my love affairs.
Mother made several efforts to open the
subject, and I always stubbornly declined
to respond to them. I made her see that
I expected no true sympathy from parents
who could treat their only child in such a
cruel fashion; and that since it would be
impossible to understand one another’s
feelings, the fewer confidences we indulged
in the better. When she gave me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
work to do, I did not sew with her in our
little morning-room as usual, but carried
my basket and materials into my bedroom,
and locked myself in to do it there. When
either of them asked me to play to them
after dinner, I went at once to the piano,
and plodded through all my pieces as they
came till they told me to stop, as if they
were so many five-finger exercises. I was
dearly fond of music, and I played well,
with a poetic appreciation of the subtleties
of sweet sounds; but now I carefully
eliminated every trace of feeling or
sympathy from the tender passages that
my <i>répertoire</i> was full of, and laid no more
emphasis or expression upon them than if
I were a machine. I petted and fondled
Spring with absurd extravagance, until
the poor dog’s head was quite turned—letting
him paw me over as he liked, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
lick my face, and grovel on the skirts of
my best dresses—by way of giving my
parents to understand that, if no one else
cared about me, here, at least, I had one
true friend.</p>

<p>Poor father and mother! If they had
done their duty in the matter, as I feel sure
was the case, they had to be satisfied with
virtue for its own reward. It was all the
reward they got. For, besides this difference
amongst ourselves, there sprang up
a coolness with Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Of
course these old people considered (and
a perfect right they had to do so) that
there was no one in the world to compare
with their son; and, of course, they felt
it a great indignity that my parents had
not shown themselves overwhelmed with
delight at getting the chance of such a
husband for a little chit like me. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
were both too well-bred to express this
sentiment, either by speech or manner;
but they entertained it cordially all the
same.</p>

<p>The first outward change occurred on
Sunday, when we all met at church again,
after that long, empty, wretched week.
The Smiths arrived there first on this
occasion; the old people were in their
places, and Tom, of course, was in the
choir. When I saw him there, on entering
the porch at mother’s heels (and our eyes
met at once in an intense and solemn look
of welcome), I took a sudden resolution to
follow my parents up the aisle, and seat
myself demurely in the family pew beside
them. I was quite sure they did not wish
me to leave the choir because Tom was
there; on the contrary, it would be very
repugnant to mother’s delicacy to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
such a public demonstration. But it was
highly gratifying to me to show them that
I supposed, as a matter of course, that I
was to keep as far away from him as space
permitted. It made them look like tyrants,
and me like an interesting martyr, to the
whole Smith family, if to no one else; and
of course the villagers found a topic for
gossip and speculation in such a mysterious
departure from our established habits.
When we went out to the buggies, father
shook hands with Tom cordially, and with
his old friends, and then, with visible
embarrassment, but ostentatious warmth,
he offered the stereotyped invitation to
Mr. and Mrs. Smith.</p>

<p>The old lady, with her little figure, and
her delicate face that was like a carving in
ivory, received it with the gentle dignity
of a dowager empress. “Not to-day, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
thank you, Mr. Chamberlayne,” she replied.
“We have allowed so many of the servants
to have a Sunday out to-day that we are
wanted at home to keep house.”</p>

<p>Of course it was a polite excuse, and
father knew it. Mother would have accepted
it, and said no more, but he could
not help blundering on, even to the extent
of mentioning Tom by name as included
in the invitation. Of course he got nothing
by it except a distressed feeling that things
were somehow all wrong. “I want to
have a talk with you,” he urged, in quite
a pleading tone; “I have been looking
forward to to-day to talk matters all over.”</p>

<p>“Another time, Mr. Chamberlayne,
another time,” she replied, with a touch of
asperity in her polite, high-pitched tones.
She made it evident to him, at last, that
she did not intend to accept his hospitality,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
as heretofore; and he left off pressing
her.</p>

<p>Tom, during this time, had been quietly
harnessing his horses; and now he handed
his mother into her seat, saw his father
tucked up beside her, mounted the box,
and gathered his reins together. “Good
morning, Mrs. Chamberlayne; good-bye,
Kitty,” he called in a quiet, clear voice as
he raised his hat to us. “Mr. Chamberlayne,
I will leave the gates open for you.”
And away they drove, and were soon out
of sight.</p>

<p>Poor father fumbled at his harness,
flurried and silent, cut to the heart, I knew,
by this sad change in the familiar custom
of years. I don’t know anything that
could have hurt him so much as the refusal
of his old friends to eat his dinner.
Mother, too, looked sad and dispirited;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
and, altogether, we were by no means a
cheerful party. “Oh how different it was
last Sunday!” I said to myself over and
over again.</p>

<p>When we reached our own house how
the sight of the well-spread table smote us.
There were the six places set, as they had
been set nearly every Sunday for I don’t
know how long (for the Smiths, like us,
were most punctual church-goers), and the
fat turkey, and the monstrous round of
beef, the portly ham, the piled-up bowl
of salad—all the plentiful dishes of the
regular “cold collection,” as Tom called it,
which was prepared for Sunday, mocked
us with their now absurd abundance.
When mother rang the bell, and ordered
the potatoes to be brought in, Bridget
stood still and looked at her, with mouth
and eyes open, wondering what had
happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>We did not sit over our dinners on this
occasion; nor did we on the Sunday following,
when we again dined alone, with no
leaf put into the table. But, after that,
the little differences between the two
families were swallowed up in the sorrow
that came upon them both in their now
fast-approaching separation. Our house
was by this time getting disorganized
and upset. Travelling-boxes and packing-cases,
and messes of all sorts, were strewn
about the dainty rooms, which were
stripped of ornaments and curtains, and
sometimes of carpets also—one or two of
these latter, which had been made to order
for us in England, and some Persian rugs,
being too precious and pretty to part with.
Mother’s best glass and china were heaped
on a table, to be no more used at Narraporwidgee;
her linen closet was emptied and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
its contents spread in neat piles on her
bedroom floor, all her hoards of household
treasures were like drapers’ goods at stock-taking
time; she could not bear to have
her “sets” meddled with, and we had not
things to use that we wanted. We were
just beginning to feel very desolate and
uncomfortable, when one morning after
breakfast old Mrs. Smith drove up to the
door and begged us, with tears in her eyes,
to come and make our home at Booloomooroo
until the sale was over and it was time to
start for Melbourne. Mother, who went
to the door herself, put her arms round her
old friend, kissed her warmly, and accepted
the invitation; and the day after we found
ourselves transferred from our mess and
muddle to cool, sweet, orderly rooms again;
and any breach there might have been
between the two families was healed up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>It was very strange and pleasant to find
myself under the same roof with my proscribed
lover, meeting him familiarly at all
hours of the day. Many precious, if brief,
moments of happy privacy fell to us in the
accidental course of things; but we were
honourable, and we did not seek them.
We took no walks, we contrived no stolen
interviews; we played whist and billiards
with our parents during those lovely evenings
when we should have chosen to be
out of doors, with the utmost propriety—though,
I believe, if we had done otherwise
in those last days, father and mother
would have carefully shut their eyes and
have taken no notice. Every day some of
us went over to Narraporwidgee with a
luncheon basket, and stayed there until
dinner-time. Sometimes Tom went too,
and helped mother to lift and carry, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
to do the rough part of her packing, or
helped father with his outdoor arrangements.
On these occasions I seldom accompanied
them, though mostly left to
please myself, but stayed with Mrs. Smith.</p>

<p>Between Mrs. Smith and me there existed
at this time a close attachment. I took
no care to avoid hurting my dear mother
by an ostentatious display of affectionate
attentiveness to her; but, at the same time,
there was a decided clandestine element in
our intercourse. When we were alone we
had long talks about Tom, and exchanged
confidences that neither of us shared with
anybody else. I made Mrs. Smith understand
and believe that I should never love
another man, if I lived to be a hundred,
and that I should consider myself as good
as married to him all the two years that
we were to be separated; and, in return,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
Mrs. Smith assured me that his heart had
been bound up in me ever since we were
boy and girl together, and that she had
long looked forward to having me for her
daughter some day. She was a chatty old
body, very imperious, very highly accomplished,
and well versed in the ways of the
polite world, in spite of the length of time
that she had been absent from it; and she
interested me in the profoundest manner
with the few glimpses she gave me of the
life she had so long done with, which I
was just beginning.</p>

<p>We used to sit in her bedroom mostly,
which was as peculiar as she was herself.
Two or three of the original chambers had
been thrown together to make it, and it
was in the shape of a letter L. Her sleeping
and dressing apparatus was in one
limb of the apartment, and the other was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
filled with couches, tables, cabinets, very
old armchairs, and all the appliances of
an ancient boudoir. Such queer old chintz
the curtains and sofa covers were made of;
such spidery legs supported such curious
articles of furniture, the like of which I
never saw before or since. I often used to
think how beautifully they must have been
packed to have stood the voyage from
England so many years ago, especially
considering what ramshackle old ships
they had in those times. Over the chimney-piece
there were some comical little
silhouettes and miniatures in ebony and
brass frames; and one day I got up from
my chair to study them carefully, while
she counted the stitches of a long piece of
knitting, with her gold-rimmed spectacles
on her thin aquiline nose.</p>

<p>“I suppose these are Tom’s ancestors,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
I said presently; “but I can’t find the
faintest resemblance in any of them to him.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, my dear,” she replied quickly;
“you have not looked well. That lady
with the powdered hair was as like what
he is now as a delicate woman could be
like a large strong man; and in that old
soldier, with all the orders on his breast,
you will also see his very image.”</p>

<p>I certainly did not see anything of the
sort. Two more absurd frumps never
were limned by any painter, and to
compare Tom with them was simply preposterous.
However, I supposed the
originals were better-looking than the
portraits, and that her memory was truer
than her eyes.</p>

<p>“Are any of these you?” I asked, after
a fruitless search for the rudiments of her
striking face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>She pointed with her knitting-pin to a
fat-cheeked child, with a great shock of
hair and no clothes to speak of, than which
anything less resembling the stately delicacy
and dignity of that aristocratic old
lady could not possibly be conceived.</p>

<p>“But I have another,” said she, laying
down her work and taking off her spectacles.
“I have long been intending to show it
to you, my dear, and also some other
things that I hope will be yours some day.”</p>

<p>With which she went to an ancient
Indian cabinet, unlocked it, and, pointing
to a modern Chubb safe, wedged into a
place that had evidently been cleared for it
out of a labyrinth of tiny shelves, drawers,
and cupboards, asked me to be good enough
to carry it to a table for her. I did so,
in great curiosity, and she drew up her
chair before it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“Lock the door, Kitty, and then come
and sit by me,” she said with an air of
solemn preparation that quite awed me.
This done (though we were quite alone
in that part of the house), we sat down to
our investigations.</p>

<p>First she took out a tray of many compartments,
which was covered with a thick
layer of cotton wool; then another similar
tray, then a third; and this she began to
uncover at one corner.</p>

<p>“Here is the miniature,” she said,
drawing it out. “Now, Kitty, if you do
marry Tom, and these become yours, I
should be much obliged to you if you
would keep this just as it is, and instruct
your eldest son to do so also. The others
you can reset as you please. You don’t
mind promising me that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course not, Mrs. Smith,—whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
you wish,” I stammered earnestly,
with the reddest red face I ever had in my
life, as I took the jewel from her. It <i>was</i>
a jewel, indeed. The miniature, which
was done on ivory, with the finish of a
mediæval missal painting, was of a lovely,
smiling, fair-haired girl—one of the sweetest
little pictures I ever looked upon; but I
hardly <i>could</i> look at it, for the ring of
great diamonds in which it was framed,
which positively made my eyes ache.</p>

<p>“Oh-oh!” I cried out in ecstasy.
“Was there ever such a locket!”</p>

<p>“Plenty, my dear,” the old lady replied
carelessly, “only you have not been in the
way to see them. But these stones are
much finer than most, certainly. I don’t
suppose you will see much better ones when
you go into society.”</p>

<p>I looked and looked, and sighed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
looked again, perfectly fascinated by this
blazing splendour, and all the curious
workmanship about it, until she took it
from my hand and laid it back in its nest.</p>

<p>“Here are the others,” she said, drawing
off the sheet of wool and pushing the tray
before me.</p>

<p>I did not want any bribing to keep faith
with Tom, but many a woman, I fancy,
would have had an imperative inducement
to do so, whether she cared for him or
not, in the prospect of becoming possessed
of such diamonds as those. Earrings, pins,
stars, buckles, necklace, tiara, bracelets,
and brooches. All quaintly fashioned
in their old silver settings, but thickly
studded with great, pure drops of liquid
light, rimmed all about with sparks of fire.
I was speechless, almost stunned, with
admiration and astonishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“They are a fine set,” said Mrs. Smith,
composedly, as she fingered them with her
slender ivory hands; “but they will want
resetting before you can wear them. Don’t
let them use gold, my dear; that is what
they do nowadays, but it is often only
a device to hide a want of pure colour in
the stones. I would keep them in silver
if I were you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Smith, it seems such a
preposterous thing for me to think of ever
wearing <i>those</i>!”</p>

<p>“They will be in their most suitable
place when worn by my son’s wife,” she
replied, with dignity. “They did not
come from Mr. Smith’s side, you understand,
Kitty; <i>I</i> inherited them, by special
bequest. And I should have been grieved,”
she added, with a sigh, “to have left them
to just anybody—a woman I had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
seen—who, perhaps, would be unworthy
to wear them. Though,” correcting herself,
“I can trust my son not to marry
an unworthy woman.”</p>

<p>I threw my arms round the old lady’s
neck, and kissed her eagerly. “If ever
I have them I will value them, and take
care of them as never diamonds were taken
care of before,” I cried, almost in tears;
“but oh, dear Mrs. Smith, you think I am
good enough for Tom, and that is more
to me than all the diamonds, lovely as
they are.”</p>

<p>“My dearest child, if I live for two
years longer, to see you and him made
happy, I shall not have much more to
live for,” she responded, tenderly. “Be
assured I think you good enough for Tom,
and the only girl good enough that I have
ever met with. There, there, don’t cry!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
Let us look at the other jewels now. They
are not much, compared with the diamonds,
of course; but there are some very
fine stones amongst them—particularly
emeralds.”</p>

<p>So we investigated the remaining trays
and compartments, and inspected all the
lesser jewels, which, without the diamonds,
would have been a splendid possession in
the eyes of a reasonable woman—emeralds,
opals, rubies, sapphires, strings of pearls,
antique watches, lovely cameos and mosaic
work, and all sorts of things. Out of
these she presently selected a curious and
beautiful Maltese cross, and laid it on the
table before me. It was of silver, though
not much silver was to be seen; there was
a large emerald in each of its points, and
all the rest was filled in with little
diamonds as thickly as they would lie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
together. She hunted amongst a heap
of chains until she found one that would
suit it—a chain made of little beads of
silver, with a spark of diamond between
each bead; and on this she slipped the
ring of the Maltese cross, and fastened
them round my neck.</p>

<p>“It is not a marriage gift, as the others
will be, Kitty,” she said; “this is a little
token of friendship from an old woman
who has loved you and yours better than
she ever expected to love anybody again;”
and here her voice changed, and she sighed
heavily.</p>

<p>“How lovely! How exquisite! How
beautiful!” I murmured, quite overcome
with grateful emotion. “Oh, Mrs. Smith,
how I shall value it! How very good you
are to me!”</p>

<p>“Tchut!—nonsense!” she replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
brusquely. “It is nothing to make a fuss
about. Not but what,” she added, “it
is a fine jewel in its way. It was given
to me by a princess, and those eight
emeralds are such as you won’t see often.
Put it on to-night, and let Tom see it; it
will please him, dear boy. And, Kitty,
whenever you wear it let it remind you,
my love, of your promise to him, and all
you and I have talked about.”</p>

<p>“It shall—it shall!” I replied, earnestly,
“though I shall not need any reminding,
dear Mrs. Smith.”</p>

<p>The buggy returned late that evening
from Narraporwidgee, and I did not meet
my parents and Tom until the gong summoned
us all to the dining-room. Here
I presented myself in my best black silk
dress that Tom liked so much, the bosom
of which, fitting to me like a soft glove,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
without a wrinkle or any kind of trimming,
made what I considered the most effective
background for my chain and cross, which
in lamplight glittered in the most amazing
manner. I had been standing before my
looking-glass to admire myself for about
a quarter of an hour beforehand, waving a
candle backwards and forwards in front of
me; and never till now did I know what
fire could burn in the depths of pure
emeralds. Even that mass of well-cut
and perfect little diamonds, in themselves
“enemies of mankind,” as Mr. Ruskin
calls them, of the most “destructive”
character, could not overpower the intense
glow and lustre of mine. My unwonted
magnificence caught the attention of everybody,
down to the sedate butler who
waited at table, as soon as I approached
the light. Mrs. Smith looked at me in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
complacent triumph; her husband, whose
life was spent in looking at <i>her</i>, withdrew
his gaze from that object for a second,
and then returned it with extra interest.
Mother regarded me with a startled surprise;
father with an astonished “Hallo,
Kitty!” and Tom with beaming satisfaction.</p>

<p>“That cross hasn’t seen the light for
a dozen years at least, Kitty,” said Tom.
“Have you given it to Kitty, mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear; it is a little keepsake
Kitty has been good enough to accept,”
she replied demurely. Whereupon he
stooped over her chair and kissed her.</p>

<p>Mother called me round the table, and,
taking the jewel in her hand, examined
it closely, and as she did so the colour
rose in her pale face. “It is much too
valuable for a young girl like Kitty,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
said, turning troubled eyes to Mrs. Smith.
“Why, these stones must be quite priceless.”</p>

<p>“They are very fair stones,” our hostess
replied coolly, beginning to ladle out the
soup; “but they are not at all too good
for Kitty. It gives me great pleasure to
see her wearing them; they will be something
to remind her of old friends when
she is far away from us.”</p>

<p>“She is so very, very careless,” began
mother again; but here I broke in to ask
her indignantly if she supposed I should
be careless of such a thing as <i>that</i>?</p>

<p>“I will give you a little Chubb to keep
it in, Kitty,” said father, with moist eyes.
“I don’t think Mrs. Smith need be afraid
of it’s not being well taken care of; the
child is not likely to have many such
treasures of her own. But I do think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
with Mary, Mrs. Smith, that it is too
valuable to”—father hesitated and cleared
his throat—“to be taken out of the family,
you know.”</p>

<p>Poor father and mother! they thought
Mrs. Smith had been making over Tom’s
inheritance to me, thereby implying that
she regarded me as his future wife. They
knew nothing of the existence of that
treasure of diamonds in the Indian cabinet,
compared with which this was almost a
trifle. Tom, who guessed what we had
been about during the afternoon, looked
across at me significantly when father
spoke, and then we both looked at our
plates, and I blushed furiously.</p>

<p>I was coming out of my bedroom earlier
in the evening, having gone to fetch some
music, when I met him striding along the
passage on his way to his usual nightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
interview with the overseer. We did not
think it wrong to stop and indulge ourselves
in a fervent hug and kiss.</p>

<p>“I am so glad mother has given you
something out of that old iron box,” he
said, touching my precious cross. “Now,
you mind what your father said, Kitty,
and don’t take it out of the family.”</p>

<p>“No fear of that,” I answered, nestling
up to him. “It will stand to me in the
place of my engagement ring, Tom. Only
I can’t wear it always, unfortunately.”</p>

<p>“Wear it that day when we meet in
England, Kitty, will you? Then, when
I see it round your dear white throat, it
will be a sign to me that you have kept
true, and are ready for me.”</p>

<p>“I will,” I said solemnly.</p>

<p class="ph3">ON THE MAIL STEAMER.</p>


<p>Our final departure from the colony was a
wretched business, and I do not feel inclined
to dwell upon it. The Smiths and
ourselves had never known until now how
strong were the bonds of friendship that
through long years had bound us together,
and Tom and I bitterly realized what a
tremendous probation ours was going to
be. It was sad to see our pretty home,
that had grown with my growth, and was
a monument of I know not what ingenuity
and contrivance, dismantled and stripped,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
and given up to strangers. It was a trial
to hear, when the sale was over, that my
beloved piano had been carted away to the
township for the butcher’s children to
strum upon; and that our drawing-room
furniture, which had been made for us
in England, was gone to adorn a public-house.
It was a sore grief to have to part
with Spring and Bronzewing, neither of
my pets being allowed to accompany me
home, of course.</p>

<p>Spring I gave to Tom to take care of,
and so I was assured of his welfare,
though the poor old dog whined and cried
at leaving me until he almost broke my
heart; but Bronzewing was too famous
and too valuable to be disposed of in any
such sentimental manner. He was put
up to auction, and was fought for by two
or three wealthy landowners in the district,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
one of whom purchased him for a sum that
was sufficient, father said, to cover the cost
of whatever finery mother and I might
choose to treat ourselves to in Paris.</p>

<p>I parted from Tom at Booloomooloo,
standing out in the public sunshine between
the doorsteps and the buggy. Our
four parents were gathered round us, all
more or less overcome, on their own account,
by the solemnity and sadness of the
occasion, and in the midst of them we
stood tight clasped in one another’s arms,
and kissed our hearts out in the bitter
sweetness of farewell. We were past
caring what they or anybody else thought
of it. My own father and mother preserved
a grave silence towards me for
hours after we had started; but if they
had raged and stormed it would have been
all the same. I should rather have enjoyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
it than otherwise, in the defiant and despairing
mood that I was then in.</p>

<p>During all our buggy and railway stages,
and our little sojournings here and there,
<i>en route</i> to Melbourne and the mail steamer,
I was too profoundly miserable to see, or
feel, or care for anything. But my natural
vivacity, and the spirit of enterprise that
always possessed me more or less, awoke
in spite of me under the novel conditions
of sea life. At the end of a fortnight or
three weeks I had revived sufficiently to
take a vigorous interest in my fellow-passengers,
and to scandalize mother by a
special partiality for a bearded young
Queenslander who taught me to play chess.
I was no good at chess, and gave no signs
of promise that I ever should be. My
head was not of that construction which
the intricacies of the game demanded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
But the learning of the moves, and of a
few rudimental calculations, was a pleasant
occupation when the teacher was so exceptionally
agreeable. I thought it was
very hard on me when mother objected
to two or three games of chess a day, just
when I was beginning to find a little
amusement to drown the thought of all
my troubles—until, to my unspeakable
surprise and disgust, the Queensland
gentleman made me an offer of marriage;
which unpleasant incident, occurring on
board ship, was unavoidably one of the
widest public interest. This happened
before we reached Galle, and threw me
back into my original low spirits for a day
or two. I recovered myself when we came
to anchor in that lovely port, and I found
myself furnished with unlimited pocket-money
(surreptitiously, from father’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
pockets) for all the charming native
rubbish that I cared to purchase. And
the addition of a number of little Indian
children to our passenger-list made the
rest of the voyage delightful. I am glad
to say my rejected lover took himself off
(though I was really very sorry for some
things to see him go) and sought distraction
in the pleasures of the chase with
some coffee-planting acquaintances. So I
and my little friends had no restraint upon
our intercourse. There were some dear
little girls, coming home with an invalid
mother and no servant, to whom I particularly
attached myself. I washed their
hands and faces, and saw that their little
wants were not overlooked at their own
table; and we played together all day
long, whensoever we had an opportunity.
They were precocious little things, and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
very strong, and had no idea of romping;
so we entertained ourselves with quiet
games.</p>

<p>One day we were absorbed in our
favourite amusement—“keeping shop.” A
sort of barricade was built up of chairs
in a retired spot of deck, to represent
the counter; the two little sisters sat on
cushions on one side, and I knelt on the
other, displaying scarfs, and veils, and
handkerchiefs as my stock-in-trade.</p>

<p>“And what can I show you to-day,
madam?” I inquired of the elder child,
with much ceremony, when we had arranged
ourselves to our satisfaction.</p>

<p>She considered for a moment, with her
wise little face full of importance, and
then she asked for some pink satin for
a ball dress. I immediately spread out
a snuff-coloured pocket-handkerchief of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
daddy’s, and she passed it through her
little fingers, knitted her brows, shook her
head; and when I told her it was cheap
at &#163;16 a yard, said she was afraid it was
not good enough. Acting on this hint I
produced a gossamer veil, which I told her
was a very sweet thing in satins, that I
thought I could let her have, as a favour,
for &#163;500 the dress. “It is a piece that
was made for the Duchess of Edinburgh,”
I explained confidentially; “only the
Duchess found that she really had so
many dresses in her trousseau that she
would never have an opportunity of wearing
it.”</p>

<p>The little one’s face shone with delight
at this announcement, and she consulted
with her sister as to the advisability of
securing such an undoubted bargain.
Forty-seven yards was rather more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
she required, she said; but I told her
that was the quantity for a court dress
with a train, and that of course I could
not cut it. So she purchased the whole,
and it was laid on one side; and then it
was her sister’s turn to be served. This
little mite had been in a fever of impatience
for the pink satin to be disposed
of; and now she burst out breathlessly,
“Please, I want some purple velvet—no,
some crimson velvet—for a ball dress, and
some diamond fringe to trim it with.”</p>

<p>I gravely brought out a woollen scarf,
and told her that that was the richest
crimson velvet that was made. It was
&#163;200 a yard, but, of course, that was a
mere trifle for such a superior article. She
trembled with excitement as she poked her
thin little finger through the holes in the
knitting, and inquired anxiously whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
I was sure that it was quite the latest
fashion.</p>

<p>“Oh dear, yes,” was my unhesitating
reply. “It is the most fashionable of all
materials this season. The Queen sent
for a dress exactly like this, only last
week.”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t have been the Queen,” broke
in the elder child, who had been watching
the proceedings critically. “Mamma says
the Queen never wears anything but
black.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, no, of course not! What
could I have been thinking of? It was
the Princess of Wales I meant. The
Princess wore it at a garden-party at
Chiswick, and it was immensely admired.
Crimson velvet has been quite the rage
ever since.”</p>

<p>“And diamond fringe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“Well, of course <i>hers</i> had diamond
fringe, because she is a princess. She
had a few of her spare boxes of diamonds
made up on purpose, and she found she
had just enough to trim the polonaise
with, without having to touch her necklaces,
and bracelets, and tiaras, and things.
But diamond fringe is not generally worn,
and I am afraid I have none by me just
now. I can show you some pearl embroidery,
if that will do, or some real
Brussels lace.”</p>

<p>As I turned to search for a strip of
tatting in my workbag, which was to do
duty for Brussels lace, I met the steady
look of a pair of keen dark eyes, watching
my proceedings from an embarrassingly
short distance. They belonged to a gentlemanly,
slight-framed man, whom I had
not noticed before, and who must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
joined us a few days previously at Galle.
He was leaning on the back of a friend’s
chair—the friend being elderly, and dozing
over a magazine on his knee, with his chin
so buried in his shirt front that his grey
beard tickled his nose—and he was resting
all his weight on his folded arms, and
looked as if he had been watching me for
any length of time. There was something
in his face which (without taking any
offensive liberty with mine) was so amused
and so comical, and I myself felt so extremely
silly, caught unawares at my
childish games, that I could not help
laughing. At this he took his arms from
his chair back, and pulled off his hat
hurriedly; and I, at the same moment,
scrambled to my feet and tilted the counter
over, to the consternation and disgust of
my little customers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>“Oh,” he exclaimed, taking two long
steps into the “shop,” and putting our
apparatus in order again, “I am so sorry!
I did not know I was an eavesdropper
until you surprised me just now. I was
so interested in the mimicry of your little
companions, and to see you amusing them
so prettily. Is not the child the mother of
the woman, as well as the father of the
man? I was just thinking that, when you
turned round, and showed me how rude I
was.”</p>

<p>I have always considered that if gentle
breeding shows itself in any physical peculiarity
at all, it is in the quality and purity
of one’s voice and accent. Tom, though
his voice was deep and sonorous, had that
clear, incisive crispness of speech which is
so expressively authoritative, as well as so
musical to listen to; and my new friend,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
with a more delicate and high-pitched
organ, resembled him so much in the using
of it that I was reminded of him at once,
and felt kindly disposed in consequence.</p>

<p>“Do not say that,” I responded frankly.
“I deserved to be laughed at, and I am
sure you could not help it.”</p>

<p>“I was not laughing at you, I assure
you,” he said warmly. “I was wishing I
had such a knack of interesting others, as
you seem to interest everybody about you.
These little ones would have had a very
dreary time of it if you had not been on
board. Wouldn’t you?” he added, addressing
the children, who were staring
at him silently, with evident disfavour.</p>

<p>“Are you coming to keep shop?” the
youngest inquired, gravely; “or do you
want to buy anything? Because we don’t
keep gentlemen’s things. Do we, Miss
Chamberlayne?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>“No,” I said, smiling; “the tailor’s shop
is over the way.”</p>

<p>“I take the hint,” he said, bowing
slightly, as he lifted his hat, and showing
a pleasant, thoughtful, friendly face, with
thin dark hair a little worn away at the
temples. And he sauntered to the far end
of the deck, and was lost to our view,
leaving me with an uneasy suspicion that I
had been pert.</p>

<p>I did not see him again—except far
away at the dinner-table—until next
morning, when, having exhausted the
treasures of imagination, in the shape of
drapery and jewels, the little girls and I
were engaged in a new game, paying calls
upon one another in different parts of the
ship. They had been to call on me in my
cabin, where I had shown them photographs
and given them cake and lemonade;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
and now I was returning their call, sitting
on the edge of my chair in a very hot
patch of sunlight, with my card-case in my
hand, while they gracefully reclined under
the shade of the awning on two more
chairs, which they vainly endeavoured to fill.</p>

<p>“And how did you leave the children,
Mrs. Mortimer?” inquired my elder
hostess. “I hope they are all quite well.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mrs. Montgomery, they
are all quite well, I am happy to say.
Marie Antoinette had rather a bad fall
downstairs this morning, and bruised her
forehead; and Gustavus Adolphus ran
away with a finger-glass last night when
the butler was clearing the table after a
large dinner-party, and fell down with it
in the hall and cut himself; but I put a
plaster on, and gave him a dose of castor
oil, and he is all right again to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Ellie, the little one,
with very round eyes, “do you give your
children castor oil when they cut their
fingers?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I replied. “It is a new
plan that was recommended to me, and I
find it answers admirably; they don’t cut
themselves half so much as they used to do
when I gave them cakes and lollies to
make them stop crying. I should strongly
advise you to try it the next time you have
any accident amongst your little ones.
By the way, <i>how</i> is your baby, Mrs. Trelawny?
I met your nurse taking it for
an airing in the carriage yesterday, and
she said she was afraid it was cutting
another tooth.”</p>

<p>Little Ellie was gazing out to sea, full of
perplexity about the castor oil; but at this
interesting question her eyes came back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
me sparkling with delight. “Yes,” she
said eagerly, “it cut a new tooth this
morning. I heard it crying when I was
in my boudoir, and I rang the bell for
Mr. Trelawny, and asked him to send for
the doctor. But he said ‘nonsense,’ so we
didn’t send, and baby got his tooth all by
himself.”</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> husband never says ‘nonsense’ to
<i>me</i>,” broke in the elder child, drawing herself
up.</p>

<p>This unexpected remark upset my
gravity, and I had to stifle a laugh in
my pocket-handkerchief. At the same time
I cast about in my mind for a new topic
of conversation, and happily thought of
servants. Before I could broach it, however,
we were interrupted by our new
acquaintance, who had evidently been
hanging about at no great distance from us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>“Shall I be the footman?” he said,
slightly lifting his hat to me, and addressing
Mrs. Montgomery, “and show this
lady out?” Before any of us could answer
him, he approached my chair, and continued,
in quite an altered tone, “Forgive
me for interrupting you again, but I really
am afraid you will risk a sunstroke if you
sit here any longer with that heat pouring
down upon your head.”</p>

<p>I admitted that it was rather warm, and
I got up from my chair, which he immediately
removed to a shady place. And,
though the little girls hoped he would go
away again, he did not. To tell the truth,
I did not want him to think that we
wished to get rid of him (and <i>I</i> did not
wish it); and I dare say he had the instinct
to divine that, though I gave him no
invitation to stay. He fell into a comfortable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
lounging attitude near me, and we
began to talk—Mrs. Trelawny and Mrs.
Montgomery nestling meanwhile upon my
skirts, in silent indignation.</p>

<p>I <i>hope</i> I am not a flirt, or anything
of that sort which I ought not to be. But
sometimes I have my doubts. It is in my
constitution, somehow, to like the society
of men better than that of women; and
nature, I am fain to hope, justifies herself
in these matters, and does not leave us
responsible. Whether it is that men are
more intellectually entertaining, or more
thoroughly cultured, or take more trouble
to make things pleasant, I do not know;
but it is certain that I have more interest,
and find more sympathy (as a rule) in the
conversation of my fellow-men than I do
in that of my fellow-women—and particularly
of my fellow-girls. I cannot help<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
it; nor, any less, can I help betraying my
preferences. It is not in me to disguise
my sentiments, though I have often tried
to do so. Now I am telling the truth
about it, I will say one thing in my own
favour—I do not want men to make love
to me, as flirts are said to do; and I am
quite positively sure that I never consciously
encourage them in that direction.
If they <i>will</i> do it—and, unhappily, they
will sometimes—it is very tiresome, of
course; and no one suffers from it more
than I do. It takes all the comfort from
my intercourse with them for ever after,
and deprives me of my pleasantest friendships
just when they begin to be valuable.
I consider this unfortunate infirmity of
nice men the one great drawback to my
enjoyment of their society.</p>

<p>I sat in a long-armed wicker chair, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
my hat off and my toes dangling, and had
a delightful chat with my new acquaintance,
undisturbed by any scruples as to
the propriety of so doing. I knew (without
thinking of it until long afterwards)
that he was not a man to take liberties, or
in any way to “forget his place;” and I
could have no shadow of uneasiness, at
this stage of our acquaintance, as to what
it might develop into if it were followed
up. Indeed, at this period of my career,
I had not begun to reflect upon these
matters—notwithstanding my experiences
with respect to the gentleman from Queensland
who had taught me chess. It had
not yet occurred to me to dream of likening
myself, even in the vaguest and most
distant way, to a flirt, or to suppose for
a moment that anybody else would presume
to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>I told my new friend, in the frankest
manner, where I had come from, and where
I was going to, and what I hoped to do
and see when I got there. I pointed out
my father and mother from amongst the
passengers—daddy hotly discussing politics
with another Australian passenger—mother
sitting with the invalid mother of my little
girls, and reading aloud to her about lady
helps; and, when I found that he was an
Englishman, and had only been absent
from his country for a few months, I
induced him to enter into the fullest particulars
as to what the life I looked forward
to would probably have for me in the way
of sight-seeing and general enjoyment.
He was giving me a charming description
of the “march-past” of the famous teams
of the coaching club, and I was listening
eagerly, unconscious of the flight of time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
when I suddenly caught sight of mother
looking at me from over the top of her
book, with a grave intentness that I found
very disconcerting. As soon as I could
I rose from my chair and went over to
her, with my little companions holding
fast to either hand.</p>

<p>“Who is that gentleman, Kitty?” she
asked quietly, looking away to where he
now stood, with his arms folded on the
railing, gazing out to sea. I was sorry
she could only see a commonplace dark-blue
back and legs, and nothing of the
refinement of his pleasant face.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, mother,” I replied.</p>

<p>“You don’t know!” she echoed in
astonishment, “Do you mean your father
is not acquainted with him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. No, I know he is
not, for I showed him which was daddy
just now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>“Then who introduced him to you,
dear?”</p>

<p>“Nobody.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know his name?”</p>

<p>“No,” I murmured shamefacedly, beginning
to see the drift of her questions.</p>

<p>“Then, my dear child, will you remember
another time that I object to your
talking to strangers. It is not”—she
hesitated, casting about for a word that
would indicate impropriety without too
plainly expressing it—“it is not good
manners. He”—glancing again at the
distant serge-clad figure by the railing—“ought
to have known better than to speak
to you, if he is what a gentleman should
be.”</p>

<p>“I am quite sure he is a gentleman,” I
said emphatically.</p>

<p>Mother made no reply. She reserved
her opinion.</p>

<p class="ph3">SOME ENGLISH RELATIONS.</p>


<p>I did not see much more of my unknown
friend after this little check upon our intercourse.
He neither sought nor avoided
me, and I did a little avoid him—the result
of which was an occasional “Good
morning” only. I think he must have
left us at Suez, for I missed him in the
train afterwards, and he was not of our
party when we set sail again. To tell the
truth, by the time our voyage was over
I had almost forgotten his existence.</p>

<p>We called our voyage over at Brindisi;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
it was over so far that we were given
up to our own devices, and no longer
bound to consult those times and tides that
wait for no man. There was no occasion
for us, as daddy said, to get to London
in a couple of days; and we certainly did
not hurry ourselves. We went to Venice,
and Florence, and Naples, and Milan, and
Rome, and all the famous continental
show-places that tourists always go to—Australian
tourists, at any rate. I was in
such a hurry to see them (for Tom had
described them all to me) that I was
allowed to overrule mother’s sensible suggestion
that we should get home first, and
come back as sightseers afterwards.</p>

<p>I was as fresh and vigorous as possible,
and so was daddy; and, if mother felt
fagged with her travels, and needed a resting-place
for the sole of her tired foot, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
was the last one to own to it. And she
got some pleasure from the knowledge that
it was not the season for tourists proper,
and that we could not therefore identify
ourselves with those objectionable persons—as
we all certainly gained a great advantage
in having quiet ways to travel
in, and the skies of spring above us. We
“planted” the bulk of our luggage in
various railway centres, and we went a
round of sight-seeing that occupied us for
several weeks, taking in (besides the places
I have named) the highways of Alpine
Switzerland, and old-world Norman cities
that struck me dumb with their beauty.
I appeared in the traditional colonial
character—not surprised at anything; for
I was simply so overpowered by the
wonder of all these astounding novelties
that I could not express myself. I gazed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
and listened, and sighed, and sometimes
rubbed furtive tears out of the corners
of my eyes; but such a spell of silence
fell upon my nimble tongue as it had
never known, perhaps, since it learned
the English language. Mother, I need
scarcely add, was highly gratified by this
unaccustomed well-bred reticence on my
part, which she had hardly expected. I
am quite sure she accounted for it to
herself on her favourite theory of the
instinct of gentle blood.</p>

<p>At Paris we took up our abode for a
week, not so much to see the lions of the
city, though we made a point of missing
none of the bigger sort, as to indulge in
an extensive course of shopping for pretty
clothes for me. It had been arranged
that, on our arrival in London, we were
to make our head-quarters for a while at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
aunt Alice’s house in South Kensington,
and, from the time that that was settled,
mother had shown herself extremely
anxious that I should be provided with
what she called a suitable outfit. Father
also spoke about it, and bade her not
consider expense in making her purchases,
for that he “should like the child to be
as well dressed as other people.” I taxed
them with thinking that I was a beauty,
and wanting to show me off to my English
relations; and when they declared that
I was a conceited monkey, and that they
never thought anything of the kind, it was
transparently evident to me that they did
not adhere to the truth quite so strictly
as usual.</p>

<p>Mother, who was a born economist, and
never, I am sure, wasted a shilling in her
life, set to work in those Paris shops as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
if she were a Baroness Rothschild at least.
She began, in the most systematic manner,
with lovely underclothing, and handkerchiefs,
and collars, and cuffs, and worked
up, through shoes and boots, dressing-gowns
and stockings, gloves, and ties,
and sash ribbons, and laces—all those
manifold little costly things that I had
hitherto been but sparingly supplied with—to
the more important features of a
bran-new wardrobe; and, then, what she
laid out upon dresses, bonnets, jackets, and
things of that sort, I should be afraid to
say. She had been born with that rare
attribute, taste, and no number of years
in the bush had had any power to impair
it; and though the clothes she bought me
had not a costly appearance, and were all
more or less simple in style, they were
so fine and delicate and distinguished-looking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
that they were fit for a princess.
Poor dear Bronzewing must have sold
well, I told father, when all our purchases
were made, including, of course, some war
paint for mother, which was of no account
to her compared with my equipment; but
he only smiled, and patted my head, and
showed himself well pleased with our
extravagance.</p>

<p>“So he did, Kitty; so he did,” he
replied, gaily. “And the wool has sold
well, too. So spend what you like; I can
afford it, my dear.”</p>

<p>We crossed the Channel at last, in rough
weather, and arrived at Charing Cross on
a cool evening of early summer, where
we found uncle Goodeve’s carriage waiting
for us, with aunt Alice sitting in it. My
uncle, who met us on the platform, stout
and smiling, with his hat in his hand, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
his polished bald head rosy with excitement,
gave us as warm a welcome as
returned prodigals could desire—a little
too warm, I fancied, for mother’s liking,
under such very public circumstances. He
was a merchant of London city, who was
not ashamed of the trade that had made
him wealthy. If anything, he was inclined
to be rather ostentatious about that fourpenny-bit
which he laid out in Covent
Garden refuse when he was seven years
old, and which was the foundation of his
fortunes. He delighted to sit at a table
groaning with solid plate and dainty dishes,
and to declare that he had dined daily off
a mutton chop and a pint of half-and-half
for nearly twenty years, or—what was
better—that “time was when he was
thankful to make a meal of potato-parings.”
He never failed to tell you, if you referred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
to him on certain every-day social and
domestic questions, that he was a “plain
man,” who had never had any time to
attend to fal-lals. A plain man he was
certainly, in more senses than one, but
hearty and hospitable, and the very soul
of all kindness. I “took to” uncle Goodeve
from the first moment that I knew him,
when he grasped my hand in both his
own, and beamed on me with eyes which,
if not quite a match for one another, and
rather put in the shade by the breadth
and substance of his cheeks, were most
truly benevolent and fatherly. And he
and I maintained, from first to last, an
unwavering friendship for one another.</p>

<p>Aunt Alice was another matter. When
the luggage, on two or three cabs, and
uncle Goodeve and father in charge of it,
had left us, and I found myself in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
family brougham with the care of all such
small matters as shawls and dressing-bags,
sitting with my back to the horses, and
my face to my mother and aunt, I could
survey the latter with great advantage,
and did not take long to make up my mind
that I should not get on with her as well
as I should with her husband. She had
the advantage of him in being decidedly
handsome in her own over-blown style.
There was a strong likeness to father, but
it was spoiled by an air of conscious importance
that he could not have worn if
he had been made king of England. She
was enormously stout, and looked a great
deal stouter in a sealskin jacket, bordered
with sable; her face was full and florid,
with at least three chins to it; and her
bonnet, which was much higher and gayer
than those we had seen in Paris, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
perched far back on some braids at the
crown of her head, did nothing to soften
its too obtrusive outlines. She was so
stout, so rosy, so magnificent in her dress,
that she gave one the idea of being prosperous
to repletion.</p>

<p>I ought to have admired her very much,
for she was exceedingly kind and cordial,
and it was pretty to see her ways to
mother, who had been made much of in
the Chamberlayne family in former days.
She held her hand and coaxed it, and she
gazed into her face, expressing again and
again her wonder and pleasure to see her
so little changed by all she had gone
through.</p>

<p>“I suppose I look older, like the rest of
us,” said mother, “but I have had no
reason to be changed otherwise. I’m sure
I can’t look careworn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said aunt Alice; “of course you
look older, as who wouldn’t in seventeen
years! But you are so like what you used
to be—I don’t mean in not looking careworn;
indeed, I can’t describe what I
mean exactly. You don’t seem to have
lost your old ways; and your style”—glancing
at mother’s travelling dress—“is
exactly what it always was, half Worth
and half Quaker.”</p>

<p>Then she turned to make a careful
survey of <i>my</i> personal appearance, and
declared herself still more astonished that
I was so unlike what she had expected me
to be, after being brought up in the bush
all my life. At which mother gazed out
of the carriage window in placid dignity,
to imply that it was an irrelevant remark,
not requiring comment.</p>

<p>“Did you expect to see me black, aunt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
and dressed in opossum skins?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“My dear, of course not. But I must
say you look—well, very different from
what I expected. A stranger would not
guess that she had not been in London
all her life, Mary,” she added in an encouraging
tone, to mother.</p>

<p>“If I had been in London all my life,”
said I, “I expect I should have been dead
tired to-night, instead of feeling as fresh as
if I had just got out of bed. Oh, mother,
I hope there are some open spaces somewhere,
where I can have a run sometimes,
and a breath of fresh air!”</p>

<p>“There spoke the wild girl of the
woods,” cried aunt Alice, laughing
merrily. But mother did not smile, as
she was expected to do, at that little joke,
and I was sorry I had spoken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>We arrived home—to a stately house in
a great square, where all the houses were
much alike—and were ushered by a liveried
man-servant into a sort of back drawing-room
(which aunt Alice called her boudoir,
though I never would). It was a
lofty room, with pale distempered walls,
and a dado of the very latest fashion, as I
was told, and some of the newest designs
in artistic furniture and ornaments. The
carpet, however, asserted itself with painful
distinctness; and over a lovely tiled
chimney-piece was reared the most enormous
pier-glass, in the most overpowering
gilt frame that, I should think, was ever
designed as a memorial of a barbaric age.
I afterwards discovered that a mammoth
pier-glass was a striking feature of each of
the lower rooms; and by-and-bye I also
discovered that this article of furniture had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
a sort of symbolic significance to uncle
Goodeve, and was thus prominent in his
establishment by his express desire. In
his early days of struggle and privation it
had stood to him as a sort of sign of
wealth and plenty, and of all that was
refined and elegant in domestic art. And
now he obstinately refused to deny himself
the pleasure of possessing it, in the largest
sizes and the most elaborate gilt frames,
though he was quite willing that aunt
Alice and the girls should indulge their
taste in “fal-lals” without any further
restriction.</p>

<p>My two cousins rose up from two low
chairs when I entered the room, and received
me with effusive affection. They
were rather small, rather bony, rather
sallow, inheriting none of that fulness of
flesh and colour of which their parents had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
enough and to spare; and they were
neither plain, like their father, nor handsome,
like their mother, nor anything particular,
in fact. I did not call them even
tolerably good-looking, though Bella, the
youngest, certainly had nice features and
very fine eyes. They wore their hair cut
in fringes on their foreheads, and pretty
well tossed about over the rest of their
heads; and their dresses were tied back so
extremely tight (a fashion that was then
in its early extravagance) that it was with
difficulty they managed to shuffle along,
for it could not be called walking.</p>

<p>However, they were very kind and
attentive, and my heart warmed to them.
They took off my hat, and loosened my
jacket, and drew the softest low chair to
the fireside for me to sit in; and they commiserated
me for having made that “dreadful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
trip” across that “awful Channel,” and
for all the rest of my late fatigues, in a
manner that I much enjoyed, though conscious
that my face proclaimed the prosaic
fact that I felt rather invigorated than
otherwise by what I had undergone. A
youthful page in brass buttons brought in
a silver tray of little teacups, with their
elongated saucers garnished with wafers of
bread and butter; and we sipped and nibbled
as we exchanged our little questions
and replies, until it occurred to them that
I might like to go to my room, whither
they both accompanied me, and where I
found a fire, and some fresh flowers, and
little welcomes of that kind, which I
warmly appreciated. Mother’s chamber
was close by, and she had retired into it
for the night, for she was really knocked
up. I found her in her dressing-gown, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
an armchair by the fire, and a maid
making preparations for tea at a table
beside her; and she looked happy to have
found a resting-place after all her travels.
Bertha and Bella seemed to think it very
odd that I did not want to retire also, but
were much pleased when I declared that I
would prefer to join them at dinner.</p>

<p>“Then you must make haste and dress,”
said Bertha, “for we are very late to-night,
and the bell will ring in a quarter of an
hour.”</p>

<p>“And we will send our maid to help
you,” said Bella, with which the two girls
hastened off, while I went down on my
knees, and tried to tug open a big wicker
trunk, out of which I was determined to
drag one of my prettiest new French
evening dresses, so as to look as unlike an
aboriginal Australian in opossum skins as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
possible when I appeared amongst the
family in the drawing-room. I was a
little ruffled by aunt Alice’s remarks on
my appearance, and I told mother so.</p>

<p>“Never mind, dear,” was mother’s
placid reply. “She is a good, kind creature,
but she has been amongst city people
a good many years, and perhaps that is
not quite the best school for manners.”</p>

<p>Oh, if aunt Alice had heard her!</p>

<p>A smart young maid appeared in a few
minutes, and began to toss my things over
cheerfully; gradually becoming more respectful
in her handling of them as she
became aware of their style and quality.
By the time she had laid out and examined
the dress I had chosen to wear, she was
almost reverential. And when she saw it
on me, fitting so exquisitely, and falling
away behind with that indescribable grace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
that no folds <i>will</i> take at the hands of
ordinary dressmakers, she quite went into
raptures. As I surveyed myself in the
long glass, the thought occurred to me, I
am ashamed to say, that even a perfect
French dress would not have looked as
well upon her young ladies as it did upon
me. “How I wish dear Tom could see
me!” I sighed to myself pensively.</p>

<p>I went downstairs in a majestic manner,
conscious of being nice to look at, which—scoff
as people may—is a pleasant feeling,
and not one to be ashamed of. My dress
was black, very cloudy and fluffy, with
wide, rich, apple-green ribbons looped into
it here and there. Never, when I could
help it, would I put an ornament into my
golden-chesnut braids (for Tom did not
like them meddled with); but round my
throat lay the chain of silver balls and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
diamond stars, and on my bosom shone the
emerald cross like a royal order. I joined
the family on the stairs, and went down to
dinner on uncle Goodeve’s arm. I heard
cousin Bertha say to father behind me,
“How <i>very</i> nice-looking Kitty is, uncle
Chamberlayne.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’ll do,” responded daddy in an
offhand tone, but, as I knew, swelling with
pride like a dear old turkey-cock. “She’s
not so bad, for a colonial.”</p>

<p>“But she doesn’t look the least colonial,
uncle; that is what surprises us so much.
Mamma says she cannot understand it.
We thought she’d be—well, a little shy
and awkward—a little uncomfortable in
society—that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“She’d be her mother’s daughter, wherever
she came from,” said father rather
shortly, and I felt myself redden at the
little minx’s unconscious impertinence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>At dinner I was aware that I was an
object of great curiosity and interest, and
summoned all my arts to appear calmly
unconscious of it. The eyes of one or
another were always fixed on my jewels,
which must have made a wondrous show
in such a breadth of gaslight; and other
eyes were sure to be watching furtively
every movement I made—to see, I suppose,
whether I put my knife into my
mouth or used my finger-glass to drink
out of. The conversation turned almost
entirely upon Australian topics, and my
respected relations proved themselves as
sublimely and preposterously ignorant of
our modern colonial social life as all other
stay-at-home Britons that I have met. I
was not a bit surprised. I remembered a
famous joke in <i>Punch</i>—a sketch of an
Australian cousin arriving in a Belgravian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
drawing-room at the time of afternoon tea,
and, being asked to take a cup, replying
that he “didn’t mind,” if Bella would give
him a handful of tea and a billy that he
might boil it in the customary manner on
the drawing-room coals (I wonder he
didn’t want to go out into the gardens of
the square, and cut down a tree to make
his fire with). When I reflected that
<i>Punch</i> was a journal of public opinion,
enjoying an immemorial repute and <i>prestige</i>
as a faithful mirror of contemporary
manners, I could not wonder that uncle
and aunt Goodeve and my cousins were so
astonished to see me behaving myself like
a civilised being. And what was damper
like? asked Bella, as she took a dainty
spoonful of ice pudding. And would I tell
her how it was made? And how did gold
look when it came out of those funny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
cradles? And was it really <i>good</i> satin and
silk and velvet that the rich diggers gave
their wives when they married those drabs
of emigrant girls, and drank champagne
out of buckets at their weddings? And
were we not dreadfully afraid to live
amongst those wild savages who went
about at night spearing the cattle? And
was it not very fortunate that uncle
Chamberlayne had had a sheep station,
since it was never known that they
speared sheep?</p>

<p>I had not much patience to go into details
about these things; I left it to father,
who—though he was old enough to have
known better—crammed them with shocking
falsehoods, which had the effect of confirming
their theories, and of making their
hair stand more on end than it did before.
The only information I vouchsafed was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
that I really and truly had seen a live
ornithorhyncus, and that, when shot and
taken from the river, the smell of its nasty,
soft thick body was so unspeakably disgusting
that it spoiled my appetite even
to think of it.</p>

<p>When I crept into mother’s room, to see
how she was and to say good-night—feeling
very sleepy at last, for it was one
o’clock—I confided to her my first impressions
of my cousins.</p>

<p>“They are as kind as kind can be; but
oh, mother, they are very silly!” I said
despondingly.</p>

<p>“You must not say that until you have
had time to know them,” she replied.</p>

<p>“I used to feel at home that I didn’t
care for girls,” I went on, “but to-night I
feel so more than ever. To see Bertha
finicking about the tea cups with those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
slices of lemon, and talking about the
Duchess of Edinburgh and the fashions as
if it were a matter of the very last importance,
it was so absurd! And she never
read a <i>Saturday Review</i> article in her
life—she, living in London!”</p>

<p>“There is a great deal else to read in
London, Kitty.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” I retorted, turning up my
nose, “<i>The Queen</i>, and <i>Myra’s Journal</i>,
and <i>Belgravia</i>, I suppose. Well, I hope
the men will be an improvement on the
girls. They mostly are, fortunately.”</p>

<p>“Don’t express that opinion in public,
Kitty, I beg of you.”</p>

<p>“No, mother, of course not; I’m going
to be the pink of propriety now.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, darling. Good-night. God
bless you.”</p>

<p class="ph3">ELEANOR ARMYTAGE.</p>


<p>There was to be a great gathering of the
family at aunt Alice’s house next day, in
honour of our arrival. Uncle Armytage
and aunt Kate were coming up from
their country rectory with their daughter
Eleanor, a girl of my own age, and their
son Rupert, a young fellow lately from
Oxford, now reading for holy orders.
Aunt Kate had three more children, but
they were in the school-room, and were
to be left at home with their governess.
In the evening Reginald Goodeve, whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
his sisters had proudly told me was “an
officer,” and now quartered in some suburban
barracks, was coming up to dinner,
and was to bring two of his fellow-officers
with him to make up the proper complement
of men for the party.</p>

<p>In the middle of the afternoon I was
sitting in my room by myself. I had been
sorting away my clothes in the drawers
and cupboards assigned to them, having
no maid of my own, and not wishing for
anybody else’s, and I had refused to go
out when this was done on the plea that
I wanted to write letters. Of permitted
correspondents I don’t think I had any
that I cared for sufficiently to wish to
make such a sacrifice to please them, for
I disliked writing letters, and I had an
intense desire to drive in the park, and see
the costumes and equipages displayed there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
at this season and on such a lovely day.
But I had discovered that the Australian
mail was on the point of leaving, and I
had determined to send an account of our
voyage and news of our safe arrival to
little Mrs. Barton, our late clergyman’s
wife, because I knew she would gossip
about it to the people who went to church
the Sunday after she got the letter, and
that my dearest Tom would hear it all.
Father had said “Next mail will be time
enough,” and “People never make themselves
anxious about travellers nowadays,”
when I suggested to him the propriety of
writing a line to the Smiths, or of asking
mother to do so; but, of course, they did
not take into account the weary longing
for good tidings that my poor, dear, lonely
boy would feel. So I allowed my cousins
to carry off mother for a drive without me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
and I spread out my materials on a little
table near the window, and sat down to
my task.</p>

<p>I had not begun to write. I was resting
my head on my hand, and looking
down dreamily upon the trees and bushes
in the square below—very tiny trees and
bushes, but green and shady, and sweet
with early summer blossoms—and my
thoughts were very sad ones. I was
thinking of the little bush township and
the little brick church, with its shingle
roof and its bell tinkling cheerily from
the limb of a gum-tree, wondering whose
buggy would appropriate the particular
corner of the fence where ours used to
stand, and who would sit in the choir
instead of me, and how my dear love was
bearing the dreadful new solitude that had
come to him. How vividly I pictured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
what the Sundays would be to him now!
No merry drive home through the parrot-haunted
bush, one buggy at the tail of the
other; no stopping at Narraporwidgee for
the immemorial “cold collection” (for the
new owner was a retired storekeeper, ambitious,
like the merchant princes at home,
in his smaller way, of becoming a country
gentleman and a J.P.); no happy talks
under the apple-trees in the warm afternoons;
no hand-in-hand rambles by the
river in the lovely moonlight. I knew so
well how he would go wandering about
by himself, while his father nodded over
his English papers, and his mother dozed
in her armchair—how he would sit on
that stump at the water’s edge, with our
two dogs running races round him, with
his elbows on his knees and his face in his
hands, and think of his Kitty at the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
side of the world, and wonder if she would
keep true to him through those two long,
long years.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom,” I murmured aloud to the
empty air, while my tears dropped fast
upon the white sheet before me, “what
shall we do without one another? Oh,
what shall we do?”</p>

<p>There came a little tap at the door at
this unfortunate juncture, and I wiped my
eyes fiercely.</p>

<p>“Is anybody in,” asked a sweet-tuned
voice that I had never heard before.</p>

<p>“It must be aunt Kate,” I said to myself,
and I rose reluctantly to admit her.</p>

<p>Aunt Kate was my godmother, and my
father’s favourite sister. She had been in
the habit of sending little presents to me
on my birthday, and otherwise showing
an interest in my existence, and it seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
quite natural that she should seek me in
this affectionate haste. But it was not
aunt Kate. It was a youthful little creature,
with soft hazel eyes and a tender
pale face, dressed in the severest grey
homespun, with only big pearl buttons to
trim it, and a little grey bonnet, with a
white border peeping out under it upon
her smooth brown hair.</p>

<p>“I heard you were in, cousin Kitty,”
the sweet voice said, “so I have come to
call upon you. I am Eleanor Armytage,
and I am so glad you are come home to us
at last!”</p>

<p>Here she lifted her small arms and
clasped my neck to kiss me, whereat I—the
last person in the world to be sentimental
with strangers—hugged her fervently,
and then burst into violent weeping.
This is how I made the acquaintance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
of the best and dearest of all my English
cousins, sitting beside her on a low sofa
at the foot of the bed, with my head on
her shoulder, and my hand clasped in her
lap, like a weak-minded school-girl. I cannot
describe the delicacy of her sympathy,
and her delicate ways of expressing it,
with so much self-possession and such an
entire absence of “gush,” and yet with
such a flutter of emotion about her, and
such an evident sound of tears in her
voice. In my own rash and headlong way,
I lost my heart to her there and then.
But I only indulged in what, for me, was
an extraordinary weakness for a very few
seconds, and then I sat bolt upright and
abused myself roundly.</p>

<p>“No, I am not a bit tired, and I do not
feel strange—people are too kind to me
for that; I’m just a great baby, and I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
ashamed of myself,” I said, scrubbing my
wet eyes angrily. “Pray don’t think I’m
such a donkey in the ordinary way, cousin
Eleanor. To think of my receiving you
for the first time by falling on your neck
and weeping, like a born idiot!”</p>

<p>“Don’t call yourself any more names,
Kitty,” broke in Eleanor, with a rather
hysterical laugh. “I’m sure I understand
it. I know it just happens—just once in
a way—when you are thinking of things
that even if a dog comes and looks at you
it upsets you somehow, when an army of
soldiers wouldn’t do it.”</p>

<p>When she said that—so true as it was—I
thought of my dear old Spring, and
how he used to come and look at me if
anything was the matter. I could see his
great, soft, wistful eyes, as he laid his nose
on my knee, and held his feathery tail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
poised ready to wag the moment he was
satisfied that things were not so bad as he
had feared, and found himself at liberty to
offer consolation. He would never come
and look at me any more! He would stray
away to Narraporwidgee, and hunt about
for his lost mistress; and Tom would go
in search of him, and the two would sadly
wander back again, heavy-footed and
heavy-hearted under the sense of loss and
loneliness that weighed them down. I
buried my face in the sofa cushions, and
broke into such a passion of crying as I
had never indulged in since I parted from
them. This time I could not get over it
so easily. Eleanor let me alone—that is
to say, she went down on her knees beside
me, and coaxed my head with her small
pale cheek and her small warm hand, and
she kept silence while I had it out. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
blessed her for her delicate forbearance,
and began to think better of girls from
that moment, for her sake.</p>

<p>This was the worst fall I ever had in
my daily contest with memory, set always
in battle array against me, though I was
subject to periodical reverses. And Eleanor
Armytage became in a manner identified
with my inner life thenceforth, though
even to her I did not confide so much as
the name of my sweetheart, or the bare
fact that I had one. We had not “things
in common;” we were as unlike one
another as two girls of the same age,
belonging to the same class, could well
be; but in this earliest hour of our acquaintance
we inaugurated a true and
tender friendship that will certainly last
our lives. Neither of us knew what it
was to say one thing and mean another;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
we could never take one another in; we
were incapable of that amiable, half-unconscious,
and, in the main, well-meaning
hypocrisy, which, though it makes many
fervent friendships, destroys the most of
them, sooner or later; we trusted one
another with the completest trust, even
when our mutual relations were the least
agreeable, and occasionally they were not
as pleasant as they might have been. And
these I take it, are the essential conditions
of any friendship that is worthy of the
name.</p>

<p>When I began to show signs of recovery,
Eleanor poured some water into a hand-basin,
and sponged my heated face. I sat
up submissively to have it done, feeling that
I had so dreadfully disgraced myself that
I could no longer assert my dignity. “I
am so sorry,” I said meekly, “but the truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
is, I had just got a little attack of homesickness
before you came in, thinking of
my old friends. I hardly <i>ever</i> cry; but,
you know, if once you do let yourself
begin, almost anything will start you
afresh.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, I know, and I came just at
the wrong moment. I was reading to-day
in the train as I came along an old Welsh
tale of a chieftain who buried the last of
his sons, all slain in battle, and how a bird
began to sing in a tree over the grave as
they laid the body in it. It said, ‘that
broke the old chiefs heart.’ It was
nothing, of course, to all that must have
gone before, but it was just the particular
touch that pierced him. I am sure I
understand that. Do you like reading old
poetry, Kitty?” she added, hastily, fearing
this pathetic story would tempt another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
outburst if she gave me time to think
about it.</p>

<p>I told her I liked poetry of all sorts,
if it really was poetry, and not sentimental
platitudes in rhyme. And then we had
a discussion about Tennyson, and our first
“falling out”—for, having cordially agreed
that the music of some of his descriptive
passages, and the perfect beauty of some
special poems and verses were enough to
haunt one’s memory to one’s dying day,
she went on to glorify him as an infallible
deity in human shape, while I contended
that a man who wrote such shocking bad
grammar as he sometimes did hadn’t
learned his art, notwithstanding the years
he had been about it. First, she denied
the accusation against his grammar with
indignation (touched with an air of kindly
toleration for a critic who probably did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
not know good grammar when she saw
it); and then I quoted several passages
in proof of it from a volume lying on a
table at my hand, in a clear prose voice
of triumph. Whereat, having to shift her
ground, she planted herself upon the very
popular theory that a great poet was
“above those trivial considerations,” as
being, in her opinion, a perfectly safe basis
of operations. Upon which I hotly insisted
that a poet had his responsibilities as well
as his privileges in his dealings with his
mother tongue, and asked her what she
would think of a great poet who sat down
in a room with her with his hat on.</p>

<p>Finding this argument unproductive, we
went on to discuss books in general, and
in particular the literature of the colonies;
whence I drifted into reminiscences of
Narraporwidgee life, and Eleanor told me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
of her home in Norfolk. And so we
talked—puzzling one another a little at
times, I with my childish ignorance of
some things and my wide and cultured
acquaintance with others, and she with the
strange, formal lines of thought and judgment
in which her clear intellect flowed,
until my cousins came home, and found
us laughing and gossiping over a cheerful
cup of tea, like old friends.</p>

<p>I must introduce the rest of my relations
in a few words, and have done with it.
Here is the family party, on its way to
dinner:—</p>

<p>First in order, next to mother and uncle
Groodeve, is dear aunt Kate, with her
gentle face like Eleanor’s, her soft grey
hair, her soft grey dress—less like father
in some ways than aunt Alice, but with
more of his genial frankness in her kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
eyes. A very pretty woman she must
have been when she was young; even now
she has a certain bloom and brightness in
her fair faded face that is very winning
to me, expressing, as it clearly does, a
warm, and loving, and sympathetic nature.
She is younger than aunt Alice, but she
does not wear a low-bodied dress, and
flowers in her hair, as Mrs. Goodeve does.
Some soft old lace, and a pearl brooch
at her throat, and a little lace cap with
lappets on her head, are the modest ornaments
of her elderly lady costume; and
father tells her, as he lays his broad palm
on the thin fingers she rests on his coat
sleeve, that she is prettier than she was
when she was the belle of the family, and
all the beaux of the county were after her.</p>

<p>Uncle Armytage, though he comes last,
as aunt Alice’s chosen squire, must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
introduced with his wife. Tall, large-framed,
majestic, with fine lines at the
corners of his mouth, and a noble old
Roman nose much elevated in the air, he
has a dignified and imposing presence
which awes me just a little. His voice
is measured, his accent particularly pure
and refined, his manner the least trifle
verging upon pompousness; but, as mother
says, and she ought to know, there is no
mistaking him for a well-born and well-bred
gentleman in whatever company you
find him. Every one defers to him as if
by instinct; every one listens when he
lays down the law, which he does with
the least possible imperiousness; and the
servants wait on him with a silent assiduity
that marks their (always correct) estimate
of his social importance. As a clergyman,
he is one of a class by no means rare in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
England, I am told; but looking at him
on the outside I am quite sure <i>I</i> never met
one the least like him before.</p>

<p>Behind aunt Kate and father, I come
sailing downstairs, radiant in white net
and the inevitable jewel that I am so proud
of; and Reginald Goodeve is my cavalier.
A handsome young man in the common
sense of the term, with shaven cheeks and
close-cropped head, a bold pair of dark
eyes, and a delicate, silky, dark moustache,
not to speak of a tall and slender figure
which evening clothes become, he justifies
his sisters’ inordinate admiration of him
perhaps, though I do not consider him
worthy to be for a moment compared with
Tom. Perhaps I am a little prejudiced
to-night in my first impressions. I remember
Tom’s warning to me not to have
“anything to do with” him, because he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
was not a nice fellow; and I cannot help
feeling that there is a shade of familiarity
in his way of talking to me that is not so
much cousinly as an indication that he considers
me a colonial bumpkin, and, as such,
not requiring the strict courtesy demanded
by ladies of his own world. And then
he asked me about Tom just now, before
we left the drawing-room, in a particularly
offensive manner. “How’s Tom Jones—Jack
Robinson—what’s the fellow’s name?—that
young bushman of yours who was
at Christchurch—whom Bertie Armytage
brought here to a ball once?”</p>

<p>I was very angry at his impertinence,
and I answered him haughtily, and then,
seeing him taken aback and puzzled to
understand why I should fire up at such
an innocent question, I crimsoned to the
colour of a peony; whereupon he smiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
mischievously, and began to tease me in
what I thought an extremely vulgar
manner. However, he is too bright, and
chatty, and good-humoured to be repelled
altogether; and, as we go down the stairs,
arm in arm, all in the bright gaslight, I
am in too high spirits to be disagreeable,
even if I wished.</p>

<p>Behind us, in her noiseless way, glides
pretty Eleanor, in her sober draperies of
black gauze, with one white rose in her
smooth hair, shining out against the sleeve
of her gigantic attendant, Captain Damer.
I need not describe her, though I long
to do it over again, and Captain Damer
is only a huge, ponderous, good-natured
fellow, with the biggest red moustache I
ever saw, and a voice like muffled thunder.
Behind these again hops cousin Bertha on
the arm of Lieutenant Wiggles. Bertha<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
is gorgeous in frizzled hair and a bower of
artificial flowers, and a gown so tight about
her legs that it puzzles me to understand
how she will get upstairs again when
dinner is over. Lieutenant Wiggles is a
little, skipping, dancing-master sort of
man, with a high metallic voice that
reaches me distinctly, even through the
thickness of Captain Damer’s body and his
tremendous bass notes.</p>

<p>“Your pretty little colonial heiress far
exceeds my expectations,” he is saying (the
horrid little wretch, I should like to box
his ears!).</p>

<p>“Yes,” replies Bertha, also in a clear
falsetto, and with a peculiar drawl that
I notice she wears in the evening, with
her other full-dress ornaments; “yes, she
has agreeably surprised us all. You really
would hardly know she was colonial if you
were not told.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“I am quite sure I should not. And
her dress—really now, her dress is quite
perfect—now, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, her dress!” says Bertha, with
what sounds like a sharper intonation of
voice. “Of course her dress is the correct
thing, for it was made at one of the best
houses in Paris. She did not bring <i>that</i>
from Australia.”</p>

<p>“She brought that fine figure, though.”</p>

<p>Here Captain Damer begins to thunder
away to Eleanor with a somewhat angry
vehemence. I know he is kindly trying
to shut off that obtrusive dialogue from
my ears, and I feel grateful to him. I
inwardly determine that I will make
myself pleasant to him when he comes
up from his wine, and that I will not speak
to Lieutenant Wiggles if I can help it.
Bella Goodeve and Bertie Armytage bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
up the rear of the family procession, which
is closed by aunt Alice and her distinguished
brother-in-law. Bella is a weak
copy of Bertha, and both of them (as far
as I can judge from so short an acquaintance)
fair types of a common class of
fashionable young ladies not quite in the
best society. Cousin Bertie is like his
father, in a loose, unformed, elementary
way, with a thin, bright-eyed, hook-nosed
face, a large frame unfilled and angular,
and the shy, quiet manners of a gentlemanly
boy. Some day he will be big and
handsome, I think to myself, if he does
not study too much, or fall into consumption.</p>

<p>And so we sail, and sweep, and rustle
into the dining-room, two and two, and
are marshalled to our places at the table,
which is simply a great bank of flowers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
with a shining fringe of silver and crystal
all round it, lit up by that dazzling gaslight
which I enjoy so much, and which
never makes my head ache as it does
mother’s. Uncle Armytage stands up and
says grace, the velvet-footed servants begin
to glide about with plates and dishes; Mr.
Goodeve beams upon his family party, and
says “Welcome” in every line of his kind,
ugly, fat face. And my dear father looks
round on us all, and sighs, and says to
aunt Alice, “We only want James here
to make it all complete.”</p>

<p>“James!” echoes Mr. Goodeve, with
cold astonishment. “James!—my dear
Harry, what are you thinking of?”</p>

<p>“I can’t help thinking, now we are all
together and happy, that I wish poor
James were here, too,” repeats my dearest
daddy, gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>The remark is evidently considered by
the company (some of them, at any rate)
a proof of the disastrous effects of bush
life in blunting the polite perceptions of
even well-born gentlemen, but mother
looks up at him with quick, glad eyes;
and, as for me, it is all I can do to keep
from running round the table to kiss him.</p>

<p class="ph3">MY INTRODUCTION TO MRS. GRUNDY.</p>


<p>For a few days I got on in London in
the most delightful manner. I enjoyed a
prestige and popularity in my aunt’s circle—whether
on account of my reputed
heiress-ship, or my French dresses, or my
personal attractions, or because I was a
surprising colonial curiosity, I cannot say—which
would have charmed and gratified
the least vain of girls, and I was on the
way to becoming anything but that. I
was taken to the park, and the opera, and
the Royal Academy, and the Albert Hall,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
and Westminster Abbey, driven in an
open carriage through the enchanted streets
and the lovely summer weather, in a state
of rapturous enjoyment of the novelty of
everything and the fulness and brightness
of my new life, that no words can adequately
describe. I went to Madame
Tussaud’s and the Zoological Gardens too,
surreptitiously, with daddy, at an abnormal
hour, and I could have gone on sight-seeing
all night, if any one would have
taken me. For, thanks to the vigour of
my constitution, I never knew what it was
to be tired.</p>

<p>But after a few days I got into trouble,
and this is how it was:—</p>

<p>One morning—it was either a Friday or
a saint’s day—Eleanor, who would have
lived in a church if she could, came to ask
me if I would go to service with her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
I readily complied, though I had never
done such a thing on such a day before,
except on Good Fridays and Christmas
Days, in all my life. As we walked unattended
through the quiet streets and
squares, I (naturally) thought of Tom
going to College Chapel, and I asked
Eleanor to tell me about Christchurch,
and whether she ever went to see Bertie
when he was there. She would have been
sure to go to the cathedral, of course, and
perhaps she had met Tom, who had had
a slight acquaintance with his younger
fellow-student. But Eleanor drifted off
into reminiscences of an Oxford sisterhood,
of which she had some thoughts of becoming
a humble associate, if her father
would allow her, and told me how the
sisters spent their noble lives in teaching
the young, and nursing the sick, and reclaiming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
the fallen, until her face flushed
and glowed with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I became interested in the subject, though
it was not the one I looked for, and especially
in the picturesque sketches that she
gave of their many little services in their
tiny chapel, and their meals in the great
bare refectory, and their little white-washed
black-floored dormitories, with the crucifix
on the wall over each narrow truckle bed.
My heart was stirred to hear how many of
them had given up wealth and high position
for this lowly but sacred work, and
how gentle ladies scrubbed the floors and
cooked the dinners for the families of the
poor wretched men and women whom they
went to nurse in the filthy slums and
alleys. My fancy was attracted also by
her description of the lovely needlework
that they did for the church, in those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
scanty hours when their severe rules of
self-discipline allowed them to sit down
and rest together. But, after all, it was
not a thing that I could realize—women
doing without fathers and mothers and the
tenderness of home life, and not wishing
to be married; and this was a side of the
subject that I could not for a moment
approve of. “They must just be like old
children,” I ventured to remark, thinking
what hard restrictions they put upon the
development of that human nature which
should be (perhaps above everything)
sacred, but which suffers so many indignities
always at the hands of good people.
“Life must seem very <i>small</i> to them, poor
things.”</p>

<p>“Small!” echoed Eleanor. “Oh, Kitty,
it is the very greatest and highest life,
to give up yourself entirely to the work of
God.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>“It seems to me they only want to
teach God a better way of doing things,
and I think His own way is quite good
enough, for my part.”</p>

<p>“What way?”</p>

<p>“The common way, making things
better as you go along, and enjoying yourself
all the while.”</p>

<p>“That is a very low view of life,” said
Eleanor, shaking her head.</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I can’t help what I think;
and it is against sense and reason to suppose
that He made us to want husbands
and children and happy homes, and all
the other pleasant things, and then wished
us to do without them.”</p>

<p>“Sense and reason are not the things to
go by.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Eleanor! Do you mean to say
God doesn’t speak in our sense and reason
as well as in the Bible. If you do, I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
only tell you I think you are a very irreverent
person.”</p>

<p>“Kitty,” said Eleanor, looking pale and
shocked, “it’s really dreadful to hear you
talk. If I did not know you had been
brought up in a country where the tone of
Church teaching——”</p>

<p>“Oh, there, you needn’t go on,” I interrupted
rather warmly, feeling a little like
a wrestler who has been hit below the belt.
“I know what you were going to say. I’ll
candidly admit that I am a savage and a
Hottentot, and save you the trouble. Is
this the church? What a queer hole they
have put it in!”</p>

<p>“Darling,” pleaded Eleanor, with tears
in her soft eyes, as we paused on the
threshold of the porch, and she laid her
hand on my arm, “<i>don’t</i> be so impatient,
for we must try to understand one another.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>I stooped suddenly and kissed her, and
asked her pardon for my hastiness; and
then we passed together into the church,
where, to my surprise, quite a large congregation
was assembled, and where my
little companion was speedily on her knees,
with her ungloved hands folded on the top
rail of a rush-bottomed chair, absorbed in
her devotions. I am free to confess that I
did not attend to mine as I ought to have
done. The splendour of the building, the
exquisiteness of the music, the strange
vestments of the clergy, the attitudes of
awe and reverence all around me, particularly
the appearance of several sisters of
mercy in their black robes, the first I had
ever seen, distracted my attention, in spite
of me. It was not at all like what I had
been used to.</p>

<p>Our walk back was a silent one. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
with her red-leaved Prayer-book clasped
lovingly in her hand, and a far-off rapt
look in her face, seemed too much impressed
and surrounded by the atmosphere of
worship to wish to be talked to; and I,
besides having some new ideas to think of,
had an odd feeling of Sunday about me.
There seemed something almost sacrilegious
in the bustle of the cabs and omnibuses up
and down, and the squeal of the hurdy-gurdy
that played its music-hall airs to
us as we passed, and more particularly in
the longing that presently possessed me to
have a good look into the shop windows.
This sensation, however, was but transient.
It evaporated in the brightness and colour
of the streets and the breezy freshness of
the sunny air.</p>

<p>I did not talk, but I looked to right and
left on all there was to be seen, and made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
mental comments to myself; and I began
to wonder whether we were going to South
Kensington after lunch, as mother had
proposed, and why Bertha and Bella were
so enthusiastic about the cooking classes,
when they evidently had no intention of
ever cooking anything themselves. And
when at last we came in view of my aunt’s
house round a corner, and I saw a pair of
the loveliest little bay horses I had ever
dreamed of, each with a white star on its
forehead, and not another light hair anywhere,
and both fidgeting restlessly before
the open hall-door, I did forget entirely
that I had been to church and had felt as
if it were Sunday. Eleanor slipped into
the hall and stole up the great staircase, as
if she were all alone in the world, and I
stood rooted on the pavement and thought
no more about her. A small groom, very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
dapper and polished, stood at those pretty
creatures’ heads, and to him I addressed
myself eagerly—“Whose are those horses?”</p>

<p>“Cap’n Goodeve’s, mum,” replied the
lad, touching his cockaded hat with his
snow-white glove.</p>

<p>At that moment out came cousin Regy
from the house, buttoning his own gloves
leisurely. “Hallo, Kitty,” said he, “what
do you think of them? A pretty good
match, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“They are <i>beautiful</i>,” I responded, rapturously.
“I should like to know what
you gave for them—I mean, what horses
of this sort cost in England?”</p>

<p>“I dare not tell you, Kitty, for fear you
should let it out. I gave a great deal more
than I could afford, to tell the truth; but
I hate to drive anything but the best.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course; there is no satisfaction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
in <i>that</i>,” I coolly replied, still criticising
the perfect shape and action of those two.
“How I should like to drive them!” I
added, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“I should like to see you at it,” replied
Regy, laughing. “Your wrists wouldn’t
be worth much to you afterwards.”</p>

<p>“And do you think there is nothing but
wrists wanting?” I inquired, reddening.
“Wrists are not everything.”</p>

<p>“Ladies’ wrists are not enough, at any
rate, to tackle such a pair of steam-engines
as these.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, Regy, you just let me try.
You can be ready to take the reins when
I can’t hold them any longer. May I try?
If they are properly broken, I’ll engage to
drive them from one end of London to the
other, in spite of the cabs and omnibuses.”</p>

<p>“What will you bet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“I won’t bet,” I answered; “but, if I
find I can’t do it, I’ll make you a smoking-cap,
or embroider your monogram on a set
of handkerchiefs, or anything you like.”</p>

<p>“Come along, then,” said Reginald;
“and make haste, before the girls catch
sight of you.” With which, he held back
my skirt from the wheels as I jumped into
the high seat of the phaeton, mounted
beside me, gave the small groom two
seconds to spring to his perch behind, and,
while I was settling the reins properly, the
horses almost tore them from my grasp,
and we swept down the street like a
whirlwind.</p>

<p>“I’d rather <i>not</i> go through London, if
any other way will do as well,” I suggested
timidly, as soon as I had got my breath,
and had become aware that the bays were
very nearly a match for me, and not quite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
and that, though my wrists would doubtless
suffer afterwards, they were able to
do what they had undertaken. I did not
quite like the idea of not seeing more than
a dozen yards before me at the pace we
were going.</p>

<p>“Of course, we won’t go through
London, Kitty. Good gracious, what an
awful idea! We’ll drive about the squares
here, where it is quiet, or we’ll make for
the country, if you like.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that is what I should like!
I have been longing to see the real English
country ever since I came. But where
were you going yourself, Regy? Don’t
let me interfere with your business.”</p>

<p>“I’ve no business, Kitty—none that
matters. I’m only too glad to be in
attendance upon you. The girls have
never given me a chance yet. Now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
where would you like to go? Are you
sure those brutes are not pulling your
arms off?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure,” I replied, gaily. “I have
a tolerable set of muscles, though I am a
woman, and I hope you perceive that I can
drive, Captain Goodeve. As to where I
would like to go, how can I tell? You
must choose a pretty road for me.”</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll go to Richmond;
that’s the prettiest place out, that I know
of, within our reach. You are not in a
hurry, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered, with reckless carelessness.
“Being late for lunch isn’t like
being late for dinner, is it? And I don’t
think we were going to do anything particular
this afternoon. Mother talked about
South Kensington, but it was to please me.
As far as she is concerned, she is happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
if I am out in the air. She hates me to
be cooped up as much as I hate it myself;
and this will do me more good than fifty
museums.”</p>

<p>So we “made for the country,” and a
long time we were getting to it I thought,
though the horses raged along as if it were
a matter of life and death to be back
punctually to lunch. The people on the
pavements stared at us a great deal, particularly
the men, two of whom, after
nodding to Regy, stood quite still to
survey us through their eye-glasses as we
passed. I touched the horses with the
whip, and nearly lost my command of
them, so indignant was I at this cool impertinence.
“If those are your friends,
I don’t think much of their manners,” I
remarked, as I tugged with main and
might to keep my hands still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>“They are struck by the way you drive,
Kitty,” said Regy, laughing, “and by the
uncommon pretty picture you make, sitting
up here, in that jolly little hat. I should
stare at you myself if I were in their
place.”</p>

<p>“Not in that rude way, I hope. If you
did, I should never speak to you again,”
I retorted, still indignant, but mollified.</p>

<p>So we went on and on; and my spirits
rose in the freshness of the morning and
the freedom growing around me. The
horses gradually subsided to a steady pace,
and my hands and arms became more used
to the strain they put upon them. I was
conscious that I was proving myself a good
whip; and, altogether, I so enjoyed myself
that I never thought how the time went.
My cousin and I had a good deal of conversation,
particularly in the quieter parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
of the road, and became very confidential
about our respective families and affairs.
I was in such spirits that I must have
talked to the little groom, if no one else
had been there; but Regy was as ready
to talk as I was, and made himself infinitely
more companionable and amusing
than ever his sisters had done. He asked
me many questions about Australia, and
particularly about my father’s property;
and then he informed me that his own
“governor” had been glued to the desk
and stool ever since he was a lad, and
had been anxious to put his (Regy’s) nose
to the grindstone also, but that he “wasn’t
going to touch that beastly city business,
not if he knew it.” Then he waxed communicative
about Bertha and Bella, the
former of whom he likened to Miss
Arabella Green in the “Lays of Ind,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
describing her career for two or three
seasons past as a systematic husband-hunt,
in which she had descended in a graduated
scale from seedy lords and baronets, and
merchant millionaires, to curates and
doctors, and poor subalterns in marching
regiments, and such like, at which she
had heretofore turned up her nose. “She’s
after old Damer now,” said he calmly;
“but he don’t see it, I fancy. If he fails
her, she will take to Wiggles. I think it’s
very likely Wiggles may succumb, if he
doesn’t propose to Bella first, for he’s been
living to a pretty tune lately, to pretend
to us all that he’s a gentleman, and he is
no end hard-up. They are both coming
to dine to-night. If you look out, you’ll
see her little game as plain as the nose
on your face.”</p>

<p>“I shall do nothing of the kind,” I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
answered, indignantly; “and if you don’t
know better than to talk of your own
sister in that way, Regy, you ought.
Now, I won’t hear any more. Turn the
conversation, if you please. Don’t you
think those green tints in the hedges and
gardens lovely?”</p>

<p>“I suppose they are, Miss Chamberlayne,
but they don’t strike me as remarkable.
I suppose you have never seen a
green tree before? Yours are grey, aren’t
they?”</p>

<p>I set him right upon that point, and
then I got telling him about Australian
scenery—how it was late autumn now at
Narraporwidgee, the green grass springing,
and full of mushrooms, and the rivers and
creeks rising; how mother would have
been storing her winter pears and apples,
and cherishing the last of her grapes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
tying down her batches of quince jelly
and tomato sauce; and how father would
have been carrying his gun on his shoulder
as he went about the run, on the chance
of starting a promiscuous hare. And then
I paused to think of somebody else (whom
I would not name to any Goodeve of them
all on any consideration), and of what <i>he</i>
would be doing. Whereupon Regy took
up his parable again. He talked about
autumn from his English point of view,
and of the good seasons and bad seasons
that he had experienced—what a nuisance
it was to get shooting in Kent when the
season was early and the crops were
harvested in August, so that the young
partridges were so scared and wild that
you couldn’t get near them; and what a
worse calamity it was to be invited to
a jolly place in Scotland, and to find when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
you got there that that beastly climate had
kept everything from ripening, so that the
birds hid away in the standing corn, and
the farmers made no end of a row if you
or your dogs trampled over it after them,
though it might be twenty times September,
etc.</p>

<p>So we approached Richmond; and, as
the inhabitants began to show themselves
in the quiet road, I asked Regy to take the
reins, not because I was tired, but because
I did not like to be stared at; and he very
handsomely acknowledged that I had vindicated
my reputation, and that he would
never doubt my ability to do anything any
more.</p>

<p>“And now, Kitty,” said he, as we were
climbing the street, for the first time at
walking pace, “it is much later than I
thought, and you’ll want some lunch.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
Shall we put up the horses for half an
hour, and have something at the inn?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do feel hungry,” I replied.
“I’d rather not go to the inn. Can’t we
get something at a shop, and go and sit
in the park and eat it?”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” he said, laughing in gentle
derision. And at that moment we passed
by the trees of the terrace, under which
nursemaids and children were sitting and
playing, and I saw for the first time that
enchanting picture of the valley of the
Thames, in its morning beauty and all its
early summer colours, and for a few seconds
I felt as if my breath had been taken
away.</p>

<p>“Oh, Regy,” I burst out, clasping my
hands together, “was there ever, ever anything
like that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it pretty?” said he, smiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
at my enthusiasm. “I don’t think it any
great shakes myself, because I’ve seen the
Mississippi, and Niagara, and the Rhine,
and all those places; but most people go
into raptures over it. Aunt Kate thinks,
like you, that it beats everything. I suppose
the old Thames is as fine a river as
many, after all.”</p>

<p>“A river!” I echoed, thinking of that
little watercourse between Narraporwidgee
and Booloomooloo, over which the gum-trees
shook hands, and which was crossed
by fallen logs in all directions. “Oh
Regy, <i>what</i> a river!” I wondered if Tom
had ever seen it from this point; and I
mentally determined that, when the time
came for him to ask me where I would
like to spend my honeymoon, I would propose
a sojourn in Richmond, that we might
come and sit on the terrace every day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>I gazed and gazed, until Regy and his
horses got fidgety together, and the former
reverted to the previous question. “You’d
better let me take you to the Star and
Garter, Kitty, and get you some lunch.
It won’t take any time, and these poor
little beggars”—indicating the horses—“will
be glad of a mouthful, too.”</p>

<p>When he mentioned the horses I had
nothing more to say, for I had been
brought up to a sense of the sacred duty
of taking care of those valuable commodities,
and they were his, and I was, in
a manner, his guest. But it was with
great reluctance that I dismounted from
my seat and allowed him to lead me into
the hotel, feeling instinctively that the
nature of the excursion was changed.</p>

<p>“Sit down and rest yourself, Kitty,”
said he, brightly, coming towards me down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
the long room, after a short conference
with a waiter at the door.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” I replied, nervously;
“I’m not tired. I suppose we shall not
wait more than a few minutes?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no—they are very quick, these
people. Lunch will be on the table in a
moment. But you may as well make yourself
comfortable; take off your hat, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh dear no, thank you. Regy, you
are not going to have a sit-down lunch for
me, I hope? A glass of wine and a
biscuit is all I care for—really.”</p>

<p>“A biscuit—nonsense!” said Regy;
“you just now said you were hungry.”
And then a waiter came in and cut short
my protest. The table was laid—very
quickly, it is true, but with all the appointments
of a formal meal. Regy stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
on the hearthrug and put his hands in his
pockets, and meanwhile surveying me with
such an aggravating smile under his little
silky moustache that, though I was angry
to feel myself at a disadvantage, I scorned
to let him suppose I thought the matter
of the least consequence. I turned to look
out of the window on that lovely, lovely
valley, and I asked him some questions as
to the various objects in the landscape, but
somehow I had not the same heart to
admire it now, for I kept saying to myself,
“Mother would not like me to be here
alone with Regy—I am sure she would not
like it.” However, I could not help it
now, and I did not know how much it
really mattered. The dishes were placed
on the table, and our chairs handed for
us; I was ravenously hungry, and some
fish was uncovered just under my nose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
smoking hot in its white napkin, that was
more delicious than anything I had ever
tasted. Though I was not quite easy in
my mind I made an excellent meal, and
felt all the better for it.</p>

<p>“Have some <i>pâté</i>, Kitty,” urged Regy,
as I rose and took my gloves from my
pocket.</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Regy.”</p>

<p>“Well, have some fruit. These are
early nectarines—the first of the season.”</p>

<p>“No, I have finished, thank you; and
I do think, Regy, we ought to be going.
Mother will be getting very anxious about
me,” I pleaded earnestly. “I am sorry I
came now I see how long we have been.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that, Kitty; it has been
the very jolliest morning I ever spent.
But I’ll have the horses round at once.”</p>

<p>He had them round, and we left the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
room together. On our way out we passed
a group of gentlemen; and one of them,
moving backwards, brushed against me,
and apologised. Something in his voice
was familiar to me, but I was too much
preoccupied with my hurry to get out of
doors to think about it until afterwards.
When I found myself once more in the
open air, I was easy in my mind again.
I enjoyed the drive home, though the afternoon
was warm and bright and I had no
sunshade to soften the glare on my head.
I did not drive now; I sat at my ease, and
looked at the people we passed, and at the
carriages, which, as we drew nearer London,
seemed to be setting in the direction
of Richmond like a tide. Regy was rather
silent, and took out his watch now and
then.</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t get into disgrace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
Kitty,” he said, at last, when we were once
more in the neighbourhood of his paternal
roof.</p>

<p>“Why should I?” I asked; and I
thought he took rather a liberty when he
made the suggestion.</p>

<p>“If I were you,” he went on, “I
wouldn’t say anything about the Star and
Garter, Kitty; we’ll keep that dark, shall
we?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” I replied,
proudly, lifting my head in the air.
But I felt that I was one tingling blush
to the very soles of my feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right—I didn’t mean anything.
Only I thought your mother would be
vexed, perhaps,” he said, a little tartly.</p>

<p class="ph3">LORD WESTBROOK.</p>


<p>“Vexed,” was no word to use in describing
the displeasure and mortification of
my poor dear mother when I boldly went
straight off to her with an honest account
of myself; nor, I must say, was it adequate
to express my own feelings when I comprehended—dimly
at first, and then with
sudden, blinding clearness—the enormity
of my indiscretion. I went to my own
room and sat down by the bedside, with
my hands in my lap, and said to myself,
“Oh! if it were only ten years hence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
that it might be as forgotten as if it had
never happened. Oh! if Regy had never
been born, and I had only girl cousins!”
And when Eleanor came creeping in to
look for me, I laid my burning face on her
shoulder, and had a good, hearty, downright
cry, and said to that kind friend and
comforter, “Oh! if I had never set foot
in England, Eleanor, how thankful I should
be!”</p>

<p>I had a very bad time of it altogether.
Mother and I made it up between us, for
she knew I was innocent of any idea of
impropriety, and was sorry to be obliged
to suggest it to me; and daddy was away
with uncle Armytage somewhere, and I
don’t think was ever told about it—nor
would <i>he</i> have scolded me if he had been.
But when I joined the family as they were
sipping their afternoon tea together, aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Alice took me to task, in the midst of them
all, and lectured me in a manner that
was simply intolerable. What with her
“usages of society,” and “what people
would say”—on which she harped with a
stupid reiteration and persistence that was
the more aggravating as she knew I had
heard all that was necessary on those
points from my own proper guardian—and
what with Bertha and Bella chiming in
with their well-meant but silly little excuses
for my ignorance, they drove me
into a rage amongst them, and I am afraid
I was impertinent. Aunt Kate was the
only one who thought of laying the blame
on Regy, and of course I disclaimed any
advantage to be got from that on the
ground that I had myself asked him to
take me. Upon the whole I paid dearly
for my little escapade, and not only in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
immediate punishment that I suffered. I
turned over a new leaf in life, so to speak,
and I missed something that had graced
the pages that were shut up and done
with—some innocent liberty and freshness
of youth—that I never found any more.
It was fortunate for me, however, that a
greater event occurred, to eclipse the
importance of this one, before the day
was over—at any rate, I thought it was
fortunate for a little while.</p>

<p>I was sitting on the floor of my bedroom,
with my hands clasped round my
knees, having dragged from an open drawer
beside me the dress I meant to put on for
dinner, and then fallen into a reverie in
the midst of its tumbled folds, when Bertha
and Bella burst in upon me without any
ceremony of knocking at the door.</p>

<p>“Oh, Kitty,” exclaimed my elder cousin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
flinging herself down before me, still
dressed as she had come hours ago from
her afternoon drive, in a huge Gainsborough
hat set very much on one side,
from beneath which her fringes and
feathers of fluffy hair were blown all ways
about her flushed face, “not that grey
thing, I beg of you; your white silk, or
the Brussels net, or the black and green;
one of your very best, dear; for somebody
is coming to dinner.”</p>

<p>“I know—only Regy’s friends.”</p>

<p>“Somebody <i>else</i>,” explained Bella, breaking
in. “Tell her quickly, Bertha; there
will be none too much time to get ourselves
ready.”</p>

<p>“Well then, Kitty,” announced Bertha,
with portentous solemnity, “Lord Westbrook
is coming.”</p>

<p>“And what then?” I inquired perversely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
assuming a languid manner. “I
don’t suppose he will have any particular
objection to a grey dress more than anybody
else.”</p>

<p>“But, Kitty, you don’t understand, he
is an earl, and he has never been here
before; and of course we must all look
our best. You know what an earl is, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” I replied grimly; “but I
am obliged to ask who this particular earl
is, to have so much fuss made over him.”</p>

<p>“Why, Lord Westbrook—the patron of
uncle Armytage’s living, and the squire
of Westbrook. His seat is within a mile
or two of the rectory. He met uncle
Armytage quite unexpectedly at his club
this afternoon, and your father was there
too, and it seems he has known your
father before, though I’m sure I’m puzzled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
to see how. And while they were talking
together papa joined them, and somehow
it ended in papa asking him to come and
dine with us to-night. And he said he
would. He is only in London for a few
days; he is on his way to fetch Lady Westbrook
home. She has been in Rome, and
he has been—I don’t know where—travelling
about by himself.”</p>

<p>“Rather a singular arrangement between
married people,” said I, at which
they both giggled in an ecstasy of amusement,
and then informed me that Lady
Westbrook was his mother, and that he
had as yet no wife.</p>

<p>“That is what surprises everybody,”
said Bella; “for he is not so very young.”</p>

<p>“What is he like?” I inquired, beginning
to feel interested.</p>

<p>They had never seen him, they replied;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
all they knew was that he was very grand,
and very rich, and very fond of going
about the world; that he had a big house
in Grosvenor Square, and great shootings
in Scotland, and a lovely yacht, and racing
stables, and a coach, and a perfect national
gallery of pictures. As it happened he
possessed none of these things, barring
the house, which was let to strangers more
often than not. He had an encumbered
estate, which had been at nurse since the
death of a gambling father a few years
before; and he was no more “grand”
than other people, and perhaps not so
much. There was some truth in the
pictures, about which my cousins were
coolly and disparagingly critical, having
heard that they represented modern schools
that either were out of fashion, or had
never come in. I was quite sure that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
did not know one old master from another,
any more than I did; but I did not say
so; and it did not in the least matter to
me whether Lord Westbrook’s taste in art
was orthodox or not.</p>

<p>“Now, Bella,” said Bertha, jumping up,
“we really <i>must</i> go and dress. I have my
hair to curl all over again, and so have
you. And, Kitty, make yourself nice, and
put on your emeralds, for the credit of the
family, there’s a dear. And don’t fret
yourself any more about that Star and
Garter business. I don’t suppose you met
anybody we knew, and, if you did, they’ll
remember you have just come from Australia,
and make allowances.”</p>

<p>With which well-meant effort to console
and encourage me, they hurried away to
their rooms; and Eleanor, always more
than punctual, presently came to me, ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
dressed, with her gloves and handkerchief
in her hand.</p>

<p>“Let me lace you up, Kitty,” said she,
seeing me struggling with my bodice and
tags.</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” I replied. “This
may be a pretty dress”—it was a fluffy
white cloud of Brussels net and lace—“but
it is a great bother to get into it.” Whereupon
she laced me up, and tied back my
skirt, and settled the little fichu that
crossed over my breast, and a nestling
little knot of fern leaves and flowers that
daddy had just brought me home; and,
during this performance, she told me some
more about Lord Westbrook.</p>

<p>“The last time I saw him was about
four or five years ago,” she said; “for he
is very seldom at Westbrook, and we have
never met him in London until to-day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
There was a great party at the hall for
shooting, and he was down for several
weeks; but I was too young to go out
then. I mostly saw him at church, and
once at a Sunday-school treat, when he
played cricket with the boys. He was
somewhere between twenty and thirty
then, and had not long come into his
property. He was very peculiar in many
things,” continued Eleanor. “He never
used to wear gloves out of doors, nor tall
hats; he used even to come to church in a
tweed suit and a wideawake. I suppose it
was because of living abroad and travelling
so much.”</p>

<p>“I hate dandies,” I said, turning my
head to see if my fichu set properly behind.</p>

<p>“His tenants and servants are fond of
him, though he does stay away so much,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
she went on. “He always takes care to
be well posted up in all that concerns
them, and he studies their interests more
than his father did. Besides, Mr. Barrett,
his agent, is a good, excellent man, whom
he can trust; and his mother is a kind
woman to the poor. I don’t think he is
a sound Churchman,” she wound up, with
a little sigh, “and that is a great pity.
He would have such influence if he were,
in his high position. Indeed, papa thinks
he would hardly go to church at all if it
were not to please his mother.”</p>

<p>“If he goes to please his mother, that is
very good and dutiful of him,” I observed.
I think Eleanor would have had something
to say upon this comparatively low view of
the matter, but my little travelling clock
on the mantelpiece chimed eight, and that
sent us both scuffling downstairs, for it
was the dinner hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>We found the drawing-room full of
guests; all arrived except the one most
anxiously looked for. I went through a
few hurried introductions on the arm of
my uncle, and was delivered over to Captain
Damer’s charge; and then poor Mr.
Goodeve, who was the soul of punctuality,
and a little of a <i>gourmand</i> to boot (in spite
of that traditional mutton chop and pint of
half-and-half), took out his watch and
sighed audibly. I felt disappointed in our
unconventional nobleman, who showed
himself wanting in good taste, according
to my view of things, though my cousins
apparently considered it quite correct that
so great a man should keep little people
waiting for him; but it was scarcely five
minutes over the hour when we heard him
running lightly up the stairs, and before
the servant could announce his name there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
he was in the midst of us, apologising to
his hostess with the gravest sincerity. He
had had a telegram from his mother, he
said, which obliged him to leave London
earlier than he had intended, and had
necessitated the making of some new
arrangements which had delayed him.
Aunt Alice deprecated any excuses, and
beamed upon him like a noonday sun.
The rest of the family closed up round
him, so that all I saw was the back of an
ordinary well-dressed man, slight, middle-sized,
and sinewy, and the top of a close-cropped
dark head bowing up and down.
But in the course of his introductions he
presented his face to me, and, to my unspeakable
delight and astonishment, I
recognised my acquaintance of the mail
steamer, looking at me with just the same
twinkle of amusement in his keen eyes as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
had covered me with confusion when I
first saw him. He was so ready with that
pleasant smile that it was quite evident he
had expected to meet me; but I had no
more expected to see him than to see my
dear Tom himself. I gave a joyful start,
and held out my hand eagerly, and he
grasped it with a warm and friendly pressure
that I did not hesitate to respond to.</p>

<p>“Kitty,” whispered Bertha, sidling up
to me when he had passed on, “I ought to
have told you that people don’t shake hands
when they are introduced. <i>Pray</i> don’t
forget that another time, dear.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” I responded flippantly, with
a beaming face of satisfaction, as I watched
my hero’s voyage round the room. But I
did not tell her that I had met him before,
and thereby left her to suffer agonies of
mortification at the betrayal of my ignorance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
of the “customs of society” to a lord.
When we had taken our places at table,
he was sitting—not opposite to me, where
he would have been hidden by a huge
piece of aldermanic plate, which cropped
out of the bank of flowers like a bush on
a Queen Anne garden hedge, but midway
between this and a well-filled china flower-pot,
exactly in the position which, to all
intents and purposes, <i>was</i> opposite; and
several times I caught myself looking at
him, and listening to him, instead of
attending to my dinner and my attentive
cavalier. His quiet, clear voice was easy
to hear at a distance, and would have been
very pleasant to listen to without any
associations. Though he by no means
interfered with any one else’s flow of
eloquence, or staggered anybody with an
unusually profound display of wisdom, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
seemed to talk all over the table, and to
keep the stream of conversation always
fresh and sparkling. There were none of
those “brilliant flashes of silence” to-night,
which so often make the heart of a hostess
sink within her, and aunt Alice’s beaming
face expressed the utmost satisfaction.</p>

<p>I was quite content to listen to him,
sending him a frank smile occasionally
when he said something particularly
amusing to his immediate neighbours, and
I did not want him to talk to me. I don’t
think he would have attempted it either,
only that by-and-bye uncle Goodeve took
it into his head (when recommending some
specially choice old wine) to discourse at
large upon the empty stomach of his childhood,
and how hard he had found it to
outgrow an early predilection for ginger-pop,
which for many years had been to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
the most rare and costly of attainable
beverages. This turn in the conversation
made poor aunt Alice so evidently unhappy
that Lord Westbrook quickly interposed
with a fresh and (as he thought)
harmless topic. Catching my eye at the
moment, he leaned forward, and addressed
me in a gentle tone that was perfectly
audible to a dozen people besides myself.</p>

<p>“I think I saw you in Richmond this
morning, Miss Chamberlayne, did I not?
You were coming out of the Star and
Garter as I was going in.”</p>

<p>I could not help it, though it almost
maddened me, but at this sudden and public
mention of my misdeeds the blood rose to
the very roots of my hair, and flowed a
brilliant scarlet all over me, even through
the gauzy haze on my neck and shoulders.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
Aunt Alice forgot about the ginger-pop (to
which she was accustomed), smiled grimly,
and pursed up her mouth; Bertha gave a
start, and hung her head; Regy scowled
and fidgeted, and looked uneasily at me.
Certainly they did all that in them lay to
help me to blacken my character in the
eyes of this distinguished visitor. As for
him, he glanced quickly from one to the
other, gravely puzzled and astonished, as
well he might be. He looked hard at Regy
for a moment; then his eyes swept coldly
over my face, and he turned to ask a
servant who was passing for sauce, as if
he had not spoken to me. If he had been
my oldest and dearest friend I could not
have felt more deeply hurt and shamed.
The colour sank out of my cheeks—it
seemed to be draining out of my heart, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
felt so suddenly cold and sick with my
dismay at what had happened. The other
listeners considered probably that I was
merely showing my savage bringing up by
being overwhelmed with the notice of a
lord. If <i>he</i> had only thought that, disgusting
though it would have been, I could
have borne it. But I knew as well as
possible that he suspected me of “gallivanting”
clandestinely, and of being now
found out—I, I, who might be a tomboy
and a scaramouch at times, perhaps, but
would no more have done anything “fast”
than I would have committed a theft or a
murder, knowingly. Though my bitter
mortification almost drove me into tears,
I made a struggle for appearances, and
answered him as calmly as I could—my
voice sounding very tremulous and cowardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
in my own ears. “Yes, Lord Westbrook,
I was there. It was the first time I had
seen Richmond.”</p>

<p>“And did you not admire the scenery
very much?” he then inquired, with an
anxious look of kindness that seemed to
say he was sorry for having distressed me,
though his voice was a little cold.</p>

<p>“Very much,” I replied lifting my head
and getting defiant. “My cousin says that
the Thames is not be compared with the
American rivers and the Rhine; but it is
grander than anything I have ever seen.”</p>

<p>“In its way I consider the Thames is
above comparison,” he said. “If your
cousin had been a painter or an angler he
would not have disparaged it.”</p>

<p>Here he went off into a disquisition upon
river scenery in general, and upon fishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
grounds in particular. Two or three people
soon struck into the dialogue. Somebody
began to talk of the “Strange Adventures
of a Phaeton,” which I had just read, and
had deeply fallen in love with. Captain
Damer, who neither knew nor cared to
inquire whether I had been to Richmond
with one cousin or with three, thundered
away upon all sorts of trifling topics, and
did his best to entertain me. And so
dinner went on as before.</p>

<p>But for me all the flavour was gone out
of the French dishes that wafted subtle
perfumes over my left shoulder every five
minutes or so. “No, thank you; no,
thank you; no, thank you,” I repeated
mechanically, until Captain Damer began
to think it was monotonous, and became
concerned at my loss of appetite. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
not often that I alarmed my friends on that
score, I must say.</p>

<p>“Don’t you care about these things?”
he inquired, in a smothered bellow, taking
up a gilded and crested <i>carte</i> that lay
between us. Probably he thought that a
diet of damper and mutton had disqualified
my palate for that kind of food. “To tell
the truth, no more do I,” he added.
“Fellows boast about their <i>chef</i>, you know,
and give you no end of a dinner if they
invite you to their club; but nine-tenths
of us choose a slice from a plain joint in
the coffee-room when we have only ourselves
to please.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t like slices from plain joints,
and I am very fond of made dishes,” I
replied, “though these ridiculous names,”
pointing to the <i>carte</i>, “never give you any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
idea what they are made of. Only—the
room is hot—I lunched rather late—I am
not hungry to-night.”</p>

<p>I scooped a spoonful of cream out of a
meringue as I spoke, and felt that a crumb
of its fragile substance would choke me.</p>
